Tomato USB Mod (ND version)
===========================

build 01 - 12/17/2008
---------------------

Based on the official Tomato 1.23 ND.

Added support for USB 1.1 (OHCI and UHCI) and USB 2.0.

USB support is configurable via Tomato GUI.

USB storage (Ext2, Ext3 and FAT file systems) and USB printing support.

Non-spooling printer server (p910nd 0.92) is included and started
automatically if you enable printing support. Bidirectional copying can
be disabled via GUI if it causes problems with your printer.

Fixed slow running clock problem on Asus WL-520GU. After flashing this
firmware you have to reboot the router at least once for clock to get
fixed.

UPnP is disabled by default.

Added CGI support to HTTP daemon - you can place your cgi scripts into
"/www/ext/cgi-bin" folder, and they will be executed when you access them
via http://<router_ip>/ext/cgi-bin/my_script_name.


build 02 - 12/20/2008
---------------------

Allowed changing USB settings without rebooting a router.

Fixed non-working AIR (WLAN) LED on Asus WL-520GU.

build 03 - 12/22/2008
---------------------

Cosmetic changes only.


build 04 - 12/26/2008
---------------------

Added FTP server daemon (vsftpd 2.0.7) configurable via GUI.

Updated kernel printer driver to version 0.13 and included some fixes
to the printer driver made by Asus.


build 05 - 12/31/2008 and 07 - 01/03/2009 (UNSTABLE)
------------------------------------------------------

Attempt to update Broadcom Wireless and Ethernet Controller driver to the
version 4.150.10.X (original Tomato included driver is version 4.130.19.0).

Added new setting to "QoS -> Basic Settings" page to select Qdisc
Scheduler (sfq | pfifo).

Auto-mounting for USB storage drives. When this feature is activated, and
USB drive is plugged in, all mountable partitions will be automatically
mounted to a new directories under /mnt. If you want to override default
mount points, mount your partition manually in the satrtup script, i.e.:
"mount -o noatime /dev/discs/disc0/part1 /opt".
If you mount your partition manually, it will not be re-mounted to a
default mount point.

This build, as well as builds 06 and 07 had several issues: using Wireless
Survey and/or changing some settings could crash the router or cause it
to hang.


build 08 - 01/07/2009

Centrino (2200bg etc) wireless cards.

Allowed up to 100 applications in UPnP.


build 12 - 01/25/2009
---------------------

Bug fixes: cosmetic fixes for GUI, using "Measure Noise Floor" function

"/mnt/disk#_part#" to "/mnt/LABEL".

Added support for automounting using /etc/fstab file if it exists
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab). Support for labels and UUIDs
in fstab is included. If automounting is disabled, you can still mount
your drives using fstab information by issuing "mount -a" command.
You can create and populate /etc/fstab file in Init script.

Added "nvram setfile2nvram <filename>" command to save small files in
nvram. They will be automatically restored on startup. This is another
way to create, for example, /etc/fstab file, and to make it "permanent".

Changed the on-flash filesystem from JFFS2 to JFFS 1.1 with special
modifications to the JFFS driver so that it would work on a very small
filesystem. Now JFFS partition can be mounted with as little as 192KB
available.

Updated SCSI Disk Driver to the newer version from kernel 2.4.37.
This fixes a memory leak, improves compatibility with certain devices,
and eliminates some error messages from the log (i.e. when connecting
Kingston flash drives).

Applied SCSI subsystem patch from kernel 2.4.37 to improve USB
hotplugging.

Multiple improvements for USB hotplugging to make it more robust.

Starting from this build, the mod comes in 4 different flavours:
- Standard: all standard USB and NAS features included; 120KB
  JFFS space (2 blocks) available on 4MB flash routers;
- Lite: all features of Standard but no Samba; some very minor features
  are stripped out of Busybox, about 420KB JFFS space (7 blocks)
  available on 4MB flash routers;
- No CIFS: all features of Standard but no CIFS Network filesystem
  support, about 180KB JFFS space (3 blocks) available on 4MB flash
  routers;
- Extras: all features of Standard plus Linux Ext2/Ext3 filesystem
  utilities (fdisk, e2fsck, mke2fs, mkswap), and built-in loop device
  support, no JFFS space available on 4MB flash. This version is for
  people who don't need JFFS space or have 8MB flash routers, and would
  like to be able to partition/format drives in Linux native Ext2/Ext3
  format directly on the router without installing any additional tools.
