The text files in this directory contain default nv ram data used by trx.exe to insert 
the default nvram "string=value" set into the PMON boot loader image.

Each file corresponds to a particular embedded board type.
There may be one or more files per board type -- customers may
require differing ethernet mac addresses for example.
