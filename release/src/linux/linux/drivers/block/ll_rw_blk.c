 *
 * Description:
 *    If a block device wishes to use the standard request handling procedures,
 *    which sorts requests and coalesces adjacent requests, then it must
 *    call blk_init_queue().  The function @rfn will be called when there
 *    are requests on the queue that need to be processed.  If the device
 *    supports plugging, then @rfn may not be called immediately when requests
 *    are available on the queue, but may be called at some time later instead.
 *    Plugged queues are generally unplugged when a buffer belonging to one
 *    of the requests on the queue is needed, or due to memory pressure.
 *
 *    @rfn is not required, or even expected, to remove all requests off the
 *    queue, but only as many as it can handle at a time.  If it does leave
 *    requests on the queue, it is responsible for arranging that the requests
 *    get dealt with eventually.
 *
 *    A global spin lock $io_request_lock must be held while manipulating the
 *    requests on the request queue.
 *
 *    The request on the head of the queue is by default assumed to be
 *    potentially active, and it is not considered for re-ordering or merging
 *    whenever the given queue is unplugged. This behaviour can be changed with
 *    blk_queue_headactive().
 *
 * Note:
 *    blk_init_queue() must be paired with a blk_cleanup_queue() call
 *    when the block device is deactivated (such as at module unload).

 * Here's the request allocation design, low latency version:
 *
 * 1: Blocking on request exhaustion is a key part of I/O throttling.
 * 
 * 2: We want to be `fair' to all requesters.  We must avoid starvation, and
 *    attempt to ensure that all requesters sleep for a similar duration.  Hence
 *    no stealing requests when there are other processes waiting.
 *
 * There used to be more here, attempting to allow a process to send in a
 * number of requests once it has woken up.  But, there's no way to 
 * tell if a process has just been woken up, or if it is a new process
 * coming in to steal requests from the waiters.  So, we give up and force
 * everyone to wait fairly.
 * 
 * So here's what we do:
 * 
 *    a) A READA requester fails if free_requests < batch_requests
 * 
 *       We don't want READA requests to prevent sleepers from ever
 *       waking.  Note that READA is used extremely rarely - a few
 *       filesystems use it for directory readahead.
 * 
 *  When a process wants a new request:
 * 
 *    b) If free_requests == 0, the requester sleeps in FIFO manner, and
 *       the queue full condition is set.  The full condition is not
 *       cleared until there are no longer any waiters.  Once the full
 *       condition is set, all new io must wait, hopefully for a very
 *       short period of time.
 * 
 *  When a request is released:
 * 
 *    c) If free_requests < batch_requests, do nothing.
 * 
 *    d) If free_requests >= batch_requests, wake up a single waiter.
 *
 *   As each waiter gets a request, he wakes another waiter.  We do this
 *   to prevent a race where an unplug might get run before a request makes
 *   it's way onto the queue.  The result is a cascade of wakeups, so delaying
 *   the initial wakeup until we've got batch_requests available helps avoid
 *   wakeups where there aren't any requests available yet.

 * generic_make_request: hand a buffer head to it's device driver for I/O
 * @rw:  READ, WRITE, or READA - what sort of I/O is desired.
 * @bh:  The buffer head describing the location in memory and on the device.
 *
 * generic_make_request() is used to make I/O requests of block
 * devices. It is passed a &struct buffer_head and a &rw value.  The
 * %READ and %WRITE options are (hopefully) obvious in meaning.  The
 * %READA value means that a read is required, but that the driver is
 * free to fail the request if, for example, it cannot get needed
 * resources immediately.
 *
 * generic_make_request() does not return any status.  The
 * success/failure status of the request, along with notification of
 * completion, is delivered asynchronously through the bh->b_end_io
 * function described (one day) else where.
 *
 * The caller of generic_make_request must make sure that b_page,
 * b_addr, b_size are set to describe the memory buffer, that b_rdev
 * and b_rsector are set to describe the device address, and the
 * b_end_io and optionally b_private are set to describe how
 * completion notification should be signaled.  BH_Mapped should also
 * be set (to confirm that b_dev and b_blocknr are valid).
 *
 * generic_make_request and the drivers it calls may use b_reqnext,
 * and may change b_rdev and b_rsector.  So the values of these fields
 * should NOT be depended on after the call to generic_make_request.
 * Because of this, the caller should record the device address
 * information in b_dev and b_blocknr.
 *
 * Apart from those fields mentioned above, no other fields, and in
 * particular, no other flags, are changed by generic_make_request or
 * any lower level drivers.
