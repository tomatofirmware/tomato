"\n" \
"		Run only-once actions:\n" \
"\n" \
"			'sysinit' is the first item run on boot. init waits until all\n" \
"			sysinit actions are completed before continuing. Following the\n" \
"			completion of all sysinit actions, all 'wait' actions are run.\n" \
"			'wait' actions, like 'sysinit' actions, cause init to wait until\n" \
"			the specified task completes. 'once' actions are asynchronous,\n" \
"			therefore, init does not wait for them to complete. 'restart' is\n" \
"			the action taken to restart the init process. By default this should\n" \
"			simply run /sbin/init, but can be a script which runs pivot_root or it\n" \
"			can do all sorts of other interesting things. The 'ctrlaltdel' init\n" \
"			actions are run when the system detects that someone on the system\n" \
"			console has pressed the CTRL-ALT-DEL key combination. Typically one\n" \
"			wants to run 'reboot' at this point to cause the system to reboot.\n" \
"			Finally the 'shutdown' action specifies the actions to taken when\n" \
"			init is told to reboot. Unmounting filesystems and disabling swap\n" \
"			is a very good here.\n" \
"\n" \
"		Run repeatedly actions:\n" \
"\n" \
"			'respawn' actions are run after the 'once' actions. When a process\n" \
"			started with a 'respawn' action exits, init automatically restarts\n" \
"			it. Unlike sysvinit, BusyBox init does not stop processes from\n" \
"			respawning out of control. The 'askfirst' actions acts just like\n" \
"			respawn, except that before running the specified process it\n" \
"			displays the line \"Please press Enter to activate this console.\"\n" \
"			and then waits for the user to press enter before starting the\n" \
"			specified process.\n" \
"\n" \
"		Unrecognized actions (like initdefault) will cause init to emit an\n" \
"		error message, and then go along with its business. All actions are\n" \
"		run in the order they appear in /etc/inittab.\n" \
