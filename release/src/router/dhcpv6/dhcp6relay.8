.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Ddf
.Op Fl b Ar boundaddr
.Op Fl H Ar hoplim
.Op Fl r Ar relay-IF
.Op Fl s Ar serveraddr
.Op Fl S Ar script-file
.Op Fl p Ar pid-file
.Ar interface ...
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
acts as an intermediary to deliver DHCPv6 messages between clients and
servers, and is on the same link as a client.
.\"
.Nm
needs command line arguments
.Ar interface ... ,
which specifies the list of links accommodating clients.
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Print debugging messages.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.
.It Fl f
Foreground mode (useful when debugging).
Although
.Nm
usually prints warning, debugging, or error messages to
.Xr syslog 8 ,
it prints the messages to standard error if this option is
specified.
.It Fl b Ar boundaddr
Specifies the source address to relay packets to servers (or other
agents).
.It Fl H Ar hoplim
Specifies the hop limit of DHCPv6 Solicit messages forwarded to
servers.
.It Fl r Ar relay-IF
Specifies the interface on which messages to servers are sent.
When omitted, the same interface as
.Ar interface
will be used.
When multiple 
.Ar interface
are specified, this option cannot be omitted.
.It Fl s Ar serveraddr
Specifies the DHCPv6 server address to relay packets to.
If not specified, packets are relayed to ff05::1:3 (All DHCPv6 servers).
.It Fl S Ar script-file
Specifies the script file to be executed when
.Nm
receives a RELAY-REPLY message from a DHCPv6 server.  Further detail of the
script file syntax is available in
.Xr dhcp6c 8
.It Fl p Ar pid-file
Use
.Ar pid-file
to dump the process ID of
.Nm .

.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/dhcp6relay.pid -compact
.It Pa /var/run/dhcp6relay.pid
is the default file that contains pid of the currently running
.Nm .
