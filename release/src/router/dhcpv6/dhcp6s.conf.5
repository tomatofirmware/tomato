.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6s.conf
.Nd DHCPv6 server configuration file
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /usr/local/etc/dhcp6s.conf
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains configuration information for KAME's DHCPv6 server,
.Nm dhcp6s .
The configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated
by a semi-colon (`;').
Statements are composed of tokens separated by white space,
which can be any combination of blanks,
tabs and newlines.
In some cases a set of statements is combined with a pair of brackets,
which is regarded as a single token.
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.Sh Interface specification
There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar fxp0
and
.Ar gif1.
.\"
.Sh Include statement
An include statement specifies another configuration file to be included.
The format of an include statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo

.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Interface statement
An interface statement specifies configuration parameters on the
interface.
The generic format of an interface statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic interface Ar interface
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
The followings are possible
.Ar substatements
in an interface statement.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic allow Ar allow-options
;
.Xc
This statement specifies DHCPv6 options accepted by the server.
Currently only
.Ar rapid-commit
can be specified in an
.Ic allow
statement, which specifies the server to
accept a rapid-commit option in solicit messages.
.It Ic preference Ar pref ;
This statement sets the server's preference value on the
interface to the value
.Ar pref .
The specified value will be contained in a preference option of
advertise messages.
The preference value must be a decimal integer and be between 0 and
255 (inclusive.)
.It Ic address-pool Ar pool Ar pltime Op Ar vltime ;
This statement assigns an address pool
.Ar pool
to the interface. When
.Nm
receives a allocation request for an IA-NA, it assigns one IPv6 address from this pool.
The specified pool name will be defined in a pool statement.
Regarding the
.Ar pltime
and
.Ar vltime
, please see the explanation in the
.Ar prefix
substatement in host statement section.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Host statement
A host statement specifies configuration parameters for a particular
client.
The generic format of a host statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic host Ar name
{
.Ar substatements
};
.Xc
.Ar name
is an arbitrary string.
It does not affect server's behavior but is provided for
readability of log messages.
Possible substatements are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic duid Ar ID ;
This statement defines the client's DHCP unique identifier
.Pq DUID .
.Ar ID
is a colon-separated hexadecimal sequence where each separated part
must be composed of two hexadecimal values.
This statement is used to identify a particular host by the server
and must be included in a host statement.
.It Ic prefix Ar ipv6-prefix pltime Op Ar vltime ;
This statement specifies an IPv6 prefix to be delegated to the client.
.Ar ipv6-prefix
is a string representing a valid IPv6 prefix
.Pq see the example below .
.Ar pltime
and
.Ar vltime
are preferred and valid lifetimes of the prefix, respectively.
When the latter is omitted, it will be set to the same value of
.Ar pltime.
A positive decimal number or a special string
.Ic infinity
can be specified as a lifetime.
A decimal number provides the lifetime in seconds,
while
.Ic infinity
means the corresponding lifetime never expires.
When both lifetimes are specified,
.Ar pltime
must not be larger than
.Ar vltime .
Multiple prefixes can be specified,
each of which is given by a single
.Ic prefix
statement.
In that case,
all or some of the specified prefixes will be delegated to the client,
based on required parameters by the client.
.It Ic address Ar ipv6-address pltime Op Ar vltime ;
This statement specifies an IPv6 address to be assigned to the client.
Everything is same as 
.Ar prefix
option, except that you do not need specify prefix length.
.It Ic delayedkey Ar keyname ;
This statement specifies a secret key shared with the client for the DHCPv6
delayed authentication protocol.
.Ar keyname
is a string that identifies a particular set of key parameters.
A separate
.Ic keyinfo
statement for
.Ar keyname
must be provided in the configuration file.
When this statement is specified and the client includes an
authentication option for the delayed authentication protocol in a
Solicit message,
.Ic dhcp6s
will perform the authentication protocol for succeeding message
exchanges.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Pool statement
A pool statement specifies an address pool for a particular interface.
The generic format of a pool statement is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic pool Ar name
{
.Ar substatements ;
};
.Xc
.Ar name
is an arbitrary string.
It does not affect server's behavior but is provided for
readability of log messages.
Possible substatements are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic range Ar min-addr Ic to Ar max-addr
This substatement defines the range of addresses allocated for the pool,
i.e. from 
.Ar min-addr
to
.Ar max-addr.
.El
.El
.\"
.Sh Keyinfo statement
This statement defines a secret key shared with a client to
authenticate DHCPv6 messages.
The format and the description of this statement is provided in
.Xr dhcp6c.conf 5 .
One important difference in the server configuration is,
however,
the
.Ar keyname
is referred from a
.Ic host
statement as described above.
.\"
.Sh Examples
The followings are a sample configuration to provide a DNS server
address for every client as well as to delegate a permanent IPv6
prefix 2001:db8:1111::/48 to a client whose DUID is 00:01:00:01:aa:bb.
.Bd -literal -offset
option domain-name-servers 2001:db8::35;

host kame {
	duid 00:01:00:01:aa:bb;
	prefix 2001:db8:1111::/48 infinity;
};
.Ed
.Pp
If a shared secret should be configured in both the server and the
client for DHCPv6 authentication,
it would be specified in the configuration file as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset
keyinfo kame {
        realm "kame.net";
        keyid 1;
        secret "5pvW2g48OHPvkYMJSw0vZA==";
};
.Ed
.Pp
And the
.Ic host
statement would be modified as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset
host kame {
	duid 00:01:00:01:aa:bb;
	prefix 2001:db8:1111::/48 infinity;
        delayedkey kame;
};
