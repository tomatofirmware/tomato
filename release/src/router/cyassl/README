*** Note, Please read ***

CyaSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL does.
The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means that if
you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error, unable to 
verify.  It you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having SSL_connect succeed
even if verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by
calling:

SSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling SSL_new();  Though it's not recommended.

CyaSSL Release 1.6.5 (9/9/2010)

Release 1.6.5 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and x509 v3 self signed certificate
generation.
 
For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To enable certificate generation support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-certgen

An example is included in ctaocrypt/test/test.c and documentation is provided
in doc/CyaSSL_Extensions_Reference.pdf item 11.

********************** CyaSSL Release 1.6.0 (8/27/2010)

Release 1.6.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, RIPEMD-160, SHA-512, and RSA key
generation.
 
For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add RIPEMD-160 support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-ripemd

To add SHA-512 support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-sha512

To add RSA key generation support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-keygen

Please see ctaocrypt/test/test.c for examples and usage.

For Windows, RIPEMD-160 and SHA-512 are enabled by default but key generation is
off by default.  To turn key generation on add the define CYASSL_KEY_GEN to
CyaSSL.


*************   CyaSSL Release 1.5.6 (7/28/2010)

Release 1.5.6 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, compatibility for our JSSE provider,
and a fix for GCC builds on some systems.
 
For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add AES-NI support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-aesni

You'll need GCC 4.4.3 or later to make use of the assembly.

**************  CyaSSL Release 1.5.4 (7/7/2010)

Release 1.5.4 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, support for AES-NI, SHA1 speed 
improvements from loop unrolling, and support for the Mongoose Web Server.
 
For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add AES-NI support add this option to ./configure
./configure --enable-aesni

You'll need GCC 4.4.3 or later to make use of the assembly.

***************  CyaSSL Release 1.5.0 (5/11/2010)

Release 1.5.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, GoAhead WebServer support, sniffer
support, and initial swig interface support.

For general build instructions see doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

To add support for GoAhead WebServer either --enable-opensslExtra or if you
don't want all the features of opensslExtra you can just define GOAHEAD_WS
instead.  GOAHEAD_WS can be added to ./configure with CFLAGS=-DGOAHEAD_WS or
you can define it yourself.

To look at the sniffer support please see the sniffertest app in
sslSniffer/sslSnifferTest.  Build with --enable-sniffer on *nix or use the
vcproj files on windows.  You'll need to have pcap installed on *nix and
WinPcap on windows.

A swig interface file is now located in the swig directory for using Python,
Java, Perl, and others with CyaSSL.  This is initial support and experimental,
please send questions or comments to support@yassl.com.

When doing load testing with CyaSSL, on the echoserver example say, the client
machine may run out of tcp ephemeral ports, they will end up in the TIME_WAIT
queue, and can't be reused by default.  There are generally two ways to fix
this.  1) Reduce the length sockets remain on the TIME_WAIT queue or 2) Allow
items on the TIME_WAIT queue to be reused.


To reduce the TIME_WAIT length in OS X to 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds)

sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.msl=3000

In Linux

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1

allows reuse of sockets in TIME_WAIT

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=1

works but seems to remove sockets from  TIME_WAIT entirely?

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=1

doen't control TIME_WAIT, it controls FIN_WAIT(2) contrary to some posts


******************** CyaSSL Release 1.4.0 (2/18/2010)

Release 1.3.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, better multi TLS/SSL version support
through SSLv23_server_method(), and improved documentation in the doc/ folder.

For general build instructions doc/Building_CyaSSL.pdf.

******************** CyaSSL Release 1.3.0 (1/21/2010)

Release 1.3.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, a potential security problem fix,
better porting support, removal of assert()s, and a complete THREADX port.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

******************** CyaSSL Release 1.2.0 (11/2/2009)

Release 1.2.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and session negotiation if first use is
read or write.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

******************** CyaSSL Release 1.1.0 (9/2/2009)

Release 1.1.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, a check against malicious session
cache use, support for lighttpd, and TLS 1.2.

To get TLS 1.2 support please use the client and server functions:

SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_2_server_method(void);
SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_2_client_method(void);

CyaSSL was tested against lighttpd 1.4.23.  To build CyaSSL for use with 
lighttpd use the following commands from the CyaSSL install dir <CyaSSLDir>:

./configure --disable-shared --enable-opensslExtra --enable-fastmath --without-zlib

make
make openssl-links

Then to build lighttpd with CyaSSL use the following commands from the
lighttpd install dir:

./configure --with-openssl --with-openssl-includes=<CyaSSLDir>/include --with-openssl-libs=<CyaSSLDir>/lib LDFLAGS=-lm

make

On some systems you may get a linker error about a duplicate symbol for
MD5_Init or other MD5 calls.  This seems to be caused by the lighttpd src file
md5.c, which defines MD5_Init(), and is included in liblightcomp_la-md5.o.
When liblightcomp is linked with the SSL_LIBs the linker may complain about
the duplicate symbol.  This can be fixed by editing the lighttpd src file md5.c
and adding this line to the beginning of the file:

#if 0

and this line to the end of the file

#endif

Then from the lighttpd src dir do a:

make clean
make


If you get link errors about undefined symbols more than likely the actual
OpenSSL libraries are found by the linker before the CyaSSL openssl-links that
point to the CyaSSL library, causing the linker confusion.  This can be fixed
by editing the Makefile in the lighttpd src directory and changing the line:

SSL_LIB = -lssl -lcrypto

to

SSL_LIB = -lcyassl

Then from the lighttpd src dir do a:

make clean
make

This should remove any confusion the linker may be having with missing symbols.

For any questions or concerns please contact support@yassl.com .

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

******************CyaSSL Release 1.0.6 (8/03/2009)

Release 1.0.6 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, an improved session cache, and faster
math with a huge code option.

The session cache now defaults to a client mode, also good for embedded servers.
For servers not under heavy load (less than 200 new sessions per minute), define
BIG_SESSION_CACHE.  If the server will be under heavy load, define
HUGE_SESSION_CACHE.

There is now a fasthugemath option for configure.  This enables fastmath plus
even faster math by greatly increasing the code size of the math library. Use
the benchmark utility to compare public key operations.


For general build instructions see rc1 below.

******************CyaSSL Release 1.0.3 (5/10/2009)

Release 1.0.3 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and add increased support for OpenSSL
compatibility when building other applications.

Release 1.0.3 includes an alpha release of DTLS for both client and servers.
This is only for testing purposes at this time.  Rebroadcast and reordering
aren't fully implemented at this time but will be for the next release.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

******************CyaSSL Release 1.0.2 (4/3/2009)

Release 1.0.2 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes for a couple I/O issues.  Some systems
will send a SIGPIPE on socket recv() at any time and this should be handled by
the application by turning off SIGPIPE through setsockopt() or returning from
the handler.

Release 1.0.2 includes an alpha release of DTLS for both client and servers.
This is only for testing purposes at this time.  Rebroadcast and reordering
aren't fully implemented at this time but will be for the next release.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

*****************CyaSSL Release Candidiate 3 rc3-1.0.0 (2/25/2009)


Release Candidate 3 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 adds bug fixes and adds a project file for
iPhone development with Xcode.  cyassl-iphone.xcodeproj is located in the root
directory.  This release also includes a fix for supporting other
implementations that bundle multiple messages at the record layer, this was
lost when cyassl i/o was re-implemented but is now fixed.

For general build instructions see rc1 below.

*****************CyaSSL Release Candidiate 2 rc2-1.0.0 (1/21/2009)


Release Candidate 2 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 adds bug fixes and adds two new stream
ciphers along with their respective cipher suites.  CyaSSL adds support for
HC-128 and RABBIT stream ciphers.  The new suites are:

TLS_RSA_WITH_HC_128_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_RABBIT_CBC_SHA

And the corresponding cipher names are

HC128-SHA
RABBIT-SHA

CyaSSL also adds support for building with devkitPro for PPC by changing the
library proper to use libogc.  The examples haven't been changed yet but if
there's interest they can be.  Here's an example ./configure to build CyaSSL
for devkitPro:

./configure --disable-shared CC=/pathTo/devkitpro/devkitPPC/bin/powerpc-gekko-gcc --host=ppc --without-zlib --enable-singleThreaded RANLIB=/pathTo/devkitpro/devkitPPC/bin/powerpc-gekko-ranlib CFLAGS="-DDEVKITPRO -DGEKKO"

For linking purposes you'll need

LDFLAGS="-g -mrvl -mcpu=750 -meabi -mhard-float -Wl,-Map,$(notdir $@).map"

For general build instructions see rc1 below.


********************CyaSSL Release Candidiate 1 rc1-1.0.0 (12/17/2008)


Release Candidate 1 for CyaSSL 1.0.0 contains major internal changes.  Several
areas have optimization improvements, less dynamic memory use, and the I/O
strategy has been refactored to allow alternate I/O handling or Library use.
Many thanks to Thierry Fournier for providing these ideas and most of the work.

Because of these changes, this release is only a candidate since some problems
are probably inevitable on some platform with some I/O use.  Please report any
problems and we'll try to resolve them as soon as possible.  You can contact us
at support@yassl.com or todd@yassl.com.

Using TomsFastMath by passing --enable-fastmath to ./configure now uses assembly
on some platforms.  This is new so please report any problems as every compiler,
mode, OS combination hasn't been tested.  On ia32 all of the registers need to
be available so be sure to pass these options to CFLAGS:

CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer"

OS X will also need -mdynamic-no-pic added to CFLAGS

Also if you're building in shared mode for ia32 you'll need to pass options to
LDFLAGS as well on OS X:

LDFLAGS=-Wl,-read_only_relocs,warning

This gives warnings for some symbols but seems to work.

*************************CyaSSL version 0.9.9 (7/25/2008) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, Pre-Shared Keys, over-rideable memory
handling, and optionally TomsFastMath.  Thanks to Moisés Guimarães for the
work on TomsFastMath.

To optionally use TomsFastMath pass --enable-fastmath to ./configure
Or define USE_FAST_MATH in each project from CyaSSL for MSVC.

Please use the benchmark routine before and after to see the performance
difference, on some platforms the gains will be little but RSA encryption
always seems to be faster.  On x86-64 machines with GCC the normal math library
may outperform the fast one when using CFLAGS=-m64 because TomsFastMath can't
yet use -m64 because of GCCs inability to do 128bit division.

     **** UPDATE GCC 4.2.1 can now do 128bit division ***

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.9.8 (5/7/2008) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, client side Diffie-Hellman, and better
socket handling.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.9.6 (1/31/2008) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, increased session management, and a fix
for gnutls.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.9.0 (10/15/2007) 

This release of CyaSSL adds bug fixes, MSVC 2005 support, GCC 4.2 support, 
IPV6 support and test, and new test certificates.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.8.0 (1/10/2007) 

This release of CyaSSL adds increased socket support, for non-blocking writes,
connects, and interrupted system calls.

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


****************CyaSSL version 0.6.3 (10/30/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds debug logging to stderr to aid in the debugging of
CyaSSL on systems that may not provide the best support.

If CyaSSL is built with debugging support then you need to call
CyaSSL_Debugging_ON() to turn logging on.

On Unix use ./configure --enable-debug

On Windows define DEBUG_CYASSL when building CyaSSL


To turn logging back off call CyaSSL_Debugging_OFF()

See notes below (0.2.0) for complete build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.6.2 (10/29/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds TLS 1.1.

Note that CyaSSL has certificate verification on by default, unlike OpenSSL.
To emulate OpenSSL behavior, you must call SSL_CTX_set_verify() with
SSL_VERIFY_NONE.  In order to have full security you should never do this, 
provide CyaSSL with the proper certificates to eliminate impostors and call
CyaSSL_check_domain_name() to prevent man in the middle attacks.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.

*****************CyaSSL version 0.6.0 (10/25/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds more SSL functions, better autoconf, nonblocking
I/O for accept, connect, and read.  There is now an --enable-small configure
option that turns off TLS, AES, DES3, HMAC, and ERROR_STRINGS, see configure.in
for the defines.  Note that TLS requires HMAC and AES requires TLS.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.5.5 (09/27/2006) 

This mini release of CyaSSL adds better input processing through buffered input
and big message support.  Added SSL_pending() and some sanity checks on user
settings.

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.5.0 (03/27/2006) 

This release of CyaSSL adds AES support and minor bug fixes. 

See notes below (0.2.0) for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.4.0 (03/15/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds TLSv1 client/server support and libtool. 

See notes below for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.3.0 (02/26/2006)

This release of CyaSSL adds SSLv3 server support and session resumption. 

See notes below for build instructions.


*****************CyaSSL version 0.2.0 (02/19/2006)


This is the first release of CyaSSL and its crypt brother, CTaoCrypt.  CyaSSL
is written in ANSI C with the idea of a small code size, footprint, and memory
usage in mind.  CTaoCrypt can be as small as 32K, and the current client
version of CyaSSL can be as small as 12K.


The first release of CTaoCrypt supports MD5, SHA-1, 3DES, ARC4, Big Integer
Support, RSA, ASN parsing, and basic x509 (en/de)coding.

The first release of CyaSSL supports normal client RSA mode SSLv3 connections
with support for SHA-1 and MD5 digests.  Ciphers include 3DES and RC4.
