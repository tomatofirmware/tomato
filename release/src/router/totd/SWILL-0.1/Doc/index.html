<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

SWILL (Simple Web Interface Link Library) is a programming library
that makes it relatively easy to add a web interface to programs
written in C and C++.  It does this by allowing an application to
function as a simple web-server to which users can connect using a
browser.

<p>
The primary use of SWILL is in highly specialized applications that
might benefit from the presence of a web interface, but which
don't fit into the standard model of a web-server or a typical
internet application.  For example, consider a long
running scientific simulation that consumes hundreds of hours of CPU
time as a non-interactive batch job.  When running such a simulation, it is
often useful to obtain intermediate results so that scientists can
monitor its progress.  Although it is possible to log into the machine
to examine log files and intermediate data files, this is often
inconvenient.  If, on the other hand, the simulation provided a tiny
web-server, a scientist could directly connect to their application to
obtain intermediate results all while kicking back at home, drinking a brewski, and
watching their WebTV.  That would be pretty cool.   Of course, this
obviously wouldn't apply to <em>all</em> scientists.

<P>
Specialized web servers can also be useful in other
settings--especially as a diagnostics and debugging tool.  For
instance, a compiler might use a little server to allow browsing of
internal data structure such as a parse trees (using the browser as a
sort of cheap debugging interface).  A web interface can also be a
useful way to interact with a very complicated runtime environment.
For example, in a simulated hardware environment (as might be used for
teaching operating systems), a web interface could be used to enable
different modes of operation, to selectively control different
features of the hardware, or to browse internal data structures.
Similarly, small servers can be written to provide simple network
services or tools for managing collections of machines.  In fact,
there are countless other applications that might benefit from having
a simple web interface--most of which are legal.

<p>
<b>Why?</b>

<p>
In age of freely available web-servers, application servers, and
distributed component frameworks, you might ask why a library like
SWILL is even needed.  Well, the simple answer to that question is
that these other approaches are often too bloated and excessively
complicated to be used in the small.  If you're writing an application
and you wanted to slap a web interface on it, why would you want to
link it into some enormous internet application framework?  SWILL is
an alternative that makes a lot of sense for many types of projects.

<P>
<b>A Brief History</b>

<p>
Bits and pieces of SWILL have actually been in development since 1996.
The origins are found in the Theoretical Physics Division at Los
Alamos National Laboratory where a Python-based web browser was used
to add a remote simulation monitoring capability to molecular dynamics
software running on the Connection Machine 5.  This proved to be 
rather useful to the users.

<P>
The current implementation is the result of an effort to generalize
the embedded server idea into a programming library that could be used
with a wide variety of different programs.  The primary focus has been
to make something that was small, easy to use, and could be used with
minimal conceptual overhead.   We really wanted to have a server that was 
completely self-contained and which didn't require any supporting infrastructure
to make it work.

<P>
<b>Prerequisites</b>
<P>
To get the most out of SWILL, you should have an understanding of
basic Web concepts such as HTML, forms, and possibly CGI scripting.
SWILL does not attempt to hide the details of HTML for you---it's
really only concerned with making it easy for an application to serve
dynamically generated documents through a web interface.  For
instance, you could also make it deliver XML if you were so inclined.

<p>
<b>What's with the name "SWILL?"</b>
<p>
Well, a lot of people working on Internet software sure seem to take
themselves <em>far</em> too seriously.  Enough said.  Besides, what
else would you want to serve?

<p>
<b>How is this related to "the Grid?"</b>
<p>
It's not.  Now, let's continue...

<h2>Overview</h2>

At its core, SWILL is nothing more than a simple embedded web server.  This
server provides the following set of features:

<ul>
<li>Single-threaded/single process operation (no forking, no multithreading).
<li>Support for HTTP/1.0 GET and POST operations.
<li>Dynamic content generation.
<li>Serving of files and directories.
<li>Access to HTML form variables.
<li>Security mechanisms. IP filters, basic authentication.
<li>Request logging
<li>Extensive error handling and recovery.
<li>Support for parallelism via the MPI message passing library.
</ul>

Unlike a traditional web-server, SWILL is designed to be added to
existing programs.  For this reason, it is not designed to take over
your whole application nor does it rely on programming techniques that
would alter the execution model of your program.  Instead, it is
primarily designed as an add-on.

<p>
Because of the lack of concurrency (threading), SWILL is not intended
to be a replacement for a high-traffic web server nor was SWILL created
for the purpose of creating new "internet" applications---if you would want to
do that, you might have better luck using Apache and PHP.  Sorry.

<h2>A Simple Example</h2>

Here is a very simple SWILL example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#include "swill.h"

void 
count_to_ten(FILE *f) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       fprintf(f,"%d\n", i);
   }
}

int main() {
   swill_init(8080);
   swill_handle("ten.txt", count_to_ten, 0);
   swill_file("index.html",0);
   while (1) {
       swill_serve();
   }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

In this example, the function <tt>swill_init()</tt> is used to open a
port for the server.  The function <tt>swill_handle()</tt> registers a
C function with the server under the name <tt>ten.txt</tt>.  The
function <tt>swill_file()</tt> registers a file with the server.

<p>
After some initial setup, the program enters an infinite loop and simply 
calls <tt>swill_serve()</tt> to wait for a single request.  At this point, the
server is active.

<p>
If a user uses a browser to connect to the server on port 8080 (using a URL such as
<tt>http://www.foo.com:8080</tt>), they will get a server
response.  A request for <tt>ten.txt</tt> will invoke the function
<tt>count_to_ten()</tt> and the resulting output will show up as the
result.  Similarly, a request for <tt>index.html</tt> will result in
that file being returned.  All other requests simply generate an
error message.  In addition to this, a request for the special file
<tt>info</tt> will return a list of all registered handlers and
documents.

<p>
In many cases, this use of SWILL is not exactly what you want.  This is
because the <tt>swill_serve()</tt> function blocks until a request is
actually received--preventing the application from doing useful work in the meantime.
To fix this, it is more common to use <tt>swill_poll()</tt> in some kind of processing
loop like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#include "swill.h"

void 
count_to_ten(FILE *f) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       fprintf(f,"%d\n", i);
   }
}

int main() {
   swill_init(8080);
   swill_handle("ten.txt", count_to_ten, 0);
   swill_file("index.html",0);

   for (i = 0; i < nsteps; i++) {
       swill_poll();       /* Check for an incoming request */
       ...
       ... other useful work
       ...
   }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Typically, you would insert a <tt>swill_poll()</tt> operation in
places where it made sense to temporary stop execution and service an
incoming web request.  This would depend on the underlying application
and performance issues might dictate the precise manner in which this
is done. For example, you would probably not check for requests in the
middle of a performance critical inner loop.  On the other hand, it
might make sense to check every few seconds or so.

<p>
In this example, it is important to note that SWILL is <em>not</em> in charge
of application control.  In fact, the web server is inactive except at
times when the services of SWILL are explicitly requested using
<tt>swill_serve()</tt> or <tt>swill_poll()</tt>.  This differs from a
traditional web server or application framework---reflecting the fact
that SWILL is only an extension of your original application.

<P>
Finally, it is interesting to note that SWILL does not rely upon any
special I/O functions for producing web pages.  For example, the
function <tt>count_to_ten()</tt> simply outputs data to a standard
file using <tt>fprintf()</tt>.  Thus, it is easy to use such functions
even when the web server is not activated.  Alternatively, any function
that might produce I/O in an application can be used to produce web pages.

<h2>A More Complicated Example</h2>

In the previous example, a function was used to produce simple text.  If you are up on
your HTML, functions can also produce HTML documents and images.  Here is an example
that displays PNG images of the Mandelbrot set using the GD graphics library 
(<a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd">http://www.boutell.com/gd</a>).   In addition, the example
uses an HTML form to allow users to change image properties.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/* SWILL Mandelbrot example */

#include "swill.h"
#include "gd.h"

/* Structure containing plot data */
typedef struct {
  double  Xmin;
  double  Xmax;
  double  Ymin;
  double  Ymax;
  int     Tolerance;
  gdImagePtr  im;
} MandelData;

/* Handler function that draws an image */

void mandel(FILE *f, MandelData *m) {
  double scalingx;
  double scalingy;
  double zr,zi,ztr,zti,cr,ci;
  double cscale;
  int    i,j,n;

  scalingx = (m-&gt;Xmax-m-&gt;Xmin)/m-&gt;im-&gt;sx;
  scalingy = (m-&gt;Ymax-m-&gt;Ymin)/m-&gt;im-&gt;sy;
  cscale = 256.0/m-&gt;Tolerance;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; m-&gt;im-&gt;sx; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; m-&gt;im-&gt;sy; j++) {
      zr = scalingx*i + m-&gt;Xmin;
      zi = scalingy*j + m-&gt;Ymin;
      cr = zr;
      ci = zi;
      n = 0;
      while (n &lt; m-&gt;Tolerance) {
	ztr = zr*zr-zi*zi + cr;
	zti = 2*zr*zi + ci;
	zr = ztr;
	zi = zti;
	if (ztr*ztr + zti*zti &gt; 20) break;
	n = n + 1;
      }
      if (n &gt;= m-&gt;Tolerance) gdImageSetPixel(m-&gt;im,i,j,0);
      else gdImageSetPixel(m-&gt;im,i,j,(int) (n*cscale));
    }
  }
  gdImagePng(m-&gt;im,f);
}

/* Handler that produces HTML form for changing values */

void mandelpage(FILE *f, MandelData *m) {
  double xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax;
  double xshift,yshift;
  int tol;
  fprintf(f,"&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"&gt;\n");
  if (!swill_getargs("d(xmin)d(xmax)d(ymin)d(ymax)i(tol)", &xmin,&xmax,&ymin,&ymax,&tol)) {

}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int i;

  m = (MandelData *) malloc(sizeof(MandelData));

  swill_handle("mandelpage.html", mandelpage,m);

  while (1) {
    swill_serve();
  }

}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The example consists of two separate web pages.  The function <tt>mandel()</tt> produces a PNG image of
the Mandelbrot set and the function <tt>mandelpage()</tt> produces an HTML page that includes an
inline version of the image as well as some links and a form for changing the display.  Although this
is a larger example, here are the highlights:

<ul>
<li>Server output is produced using standard C I/O functions.  For example, when an image is produced,
a standard <tt>FILE *</tt> object is simply passed to an appropriate function in the graphics library.

<p>
<li>When handlers are registered with the server, an optional data
item can be supplied. For example, information about the current image
is stored in a structure <tt>MandelData</tt>.  When the program
starts, it creates one of these objects which is then supplied to
SWILL when handler functions are registered using
<tt>swill_handle()</tt>.  On subsequent requests, this object is then
passed to handler functions as a second argument.  This style of
programming is normally used to implement generic handler functions
that might operate on a whole collection of different objects (each
registered as a different document).
  
<p>
<li>In the function <tt>mandelpage()</tt>, the function
<tt>swill_getargs()</tt> is used to parse HTTP query variables and
place their values into C variables.  This is function is somewhat
similar to <tt>scanf()</tt> except that the associated format string has to
supply HTTP variable names in addition to a format conversion code.

<p>
<li>Although it looks a little nasty, the <tt>mandelpage()</tt>
function produces raw HTML as output.  For the most part, this is done
using standard print statements.  However, a special function
<tt>swill_printurl()</tt> is used to produce URLs along with optional
query variables attached to them.  In this example, this is used to
provide links to the same page, but with modified values of the image
parameters.

</ul>

<h2>HTTP Overview</h2>

To better understand how SWILL works and its programming API, it is
useful to have a basic understanding of the HTTP/1.0 protocol.  First,
in order to deliver web pages, some kind of server has to be listening
for incoming connections on a TCP port.  Normally, web servers use
port 80.  However, since port 80 is priviledged and may already be in
use, you will have to pick some other port number.  Typically you have
to pick a number greater than 1024.  For instance, the previous
examples used port 8080.

<p>
When a browser submits a request, it is sent as a simple text message like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
GET /foo.html HTTP/1.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.73 [en] (X11; U; SunOS 5.8 sun4u)
Pragma: no-cache
Host: schlitz:8080
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1,*,utf-8
</pre></blockquote>

The first line of the request indicates the name of the document.
Subsequent lines are known as HTTP headers and contain various
information about the browser and the remote client.  The request is
terminated by a blank line (two newline characters).
For most practical purposes, the only critical part of the request is the document name 
such as <tt>/foo.html</tt>.   

<p>
In addition to requesting a document, an HTTP request may also include extra parameters
known as query variables.  These are usually attached to the URL (document name).  For example, this
request

<blockquote>
<pre>
GET /foo.html?name=Dave&pt=1234 HTTP/1.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.73 [en] (X11; U; SunOS 5.8 sun4u)
Pragma: no-cache
...
</pre>
</blockquote>

includes two query variables <tt>name</tt> and <tt>pt</tt>.  More
often than not, query variables show up when you start using HTML
forms.  However, they may be manually attached to any URL that you
might include in an HTML document.  Also, this string of query values (after
the <tt>?</tt>) is sometimes called a query string.

<p>
After a request has been received, the server sends back a response.  A typical
response looks like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 12734

&lt;html&gt;
... rest of document ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

The first line of the response is a response code.  After the code, a
series of headers appear.  These give information about the server and
the document itself (file type, length, etc.).  The headers are
terminated by a blank line.  After that, you find the raw document
data.

<p>
That's about all there is to the basic HTTP protocol.  As one might expect, there are
more advanced aspects of the protocol related to caching, security, and so forth. 
However, it's really not necessary to worry about this too much.

<h2>Controlling the SWILL server</h2>

The following functions are used to control the server.

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_init(int port)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Initializes the server and makes it start listening on the TCP port specified in <tt>port</tt>.  If <tt>port</tt> is set to zero,
the server will simply pick any available port.  Returns the port number on success or zero on failure.   Only one server may
be active at any given time.   Calling <tt>swill_init()</tt> more than once will generate an assertion error.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_close()</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Shuts down the server created using <tt>swill_init()</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>char *swill_title(const char *title);</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets the title string used on various SWILL-generated pages.  This is optional, but typically you would use
this function to supply the name of your application.  The function always returns the current title string. 
If the <tt>title</tt> argument is NULL, the current title is returned.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_log(FILE *log)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Supplies a file that should be used for logging web connections.
<tt>log</tt> can be any file opened for writing with <tt>fopen()</tt>
or a related library function.  
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_serve()</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Waits for an incoming web request.  The calling process is blocked until an incoming connection
is actually received.  The return code is currently undefined.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_poll()</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Polls for an incoming connection.   If a connection is found, the resulting request is serviced.
Returns 0 if no connection was found, 1 if a request was serviced.
</blockquote>

<h2>Handler functions</h2>

Most output generated by SWILL is produced by special handler
functions that are invoked when certain web pages are accessed.  The
official prototype of these handler functions is as follows:

<p>
<b><tt>typedef void SwillHandler(FILE *out, void *clientdata)</tt></b>

<p>
To register a handler with the server, the special <tt>swill_handle()</tt> function is used.

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_handle(const char *url, SwillHandler *handler, void *clientdata)</tt></b>

<blockquote>
Registers a new page with the web server. <tt>url</tt> is the name of the document that must be
supplied by the user in the browser.  <tt>handler</tt> is a callback function that will be invoked
when the web page is accessed.  <tt>clientdata</tt> is a user-supplied pointer that is passed when calling
the handler function.
</blockquote>

When a document is registered with the server, the supplied
<tt>url</tt> is used to control a few different properties of the server.  First, the document suffix
implicitly determines the document type.   Currently SWILL recognizes the following file types:

<blockquote>
<pre>
file.txt        Plaintext file   (text/plain)
file.htm        HTML document    (text/html)
file.html       HTML document    (text/html)
file.gif        GIF image        (image/gif)
file.png        PNG image        (image/png)
file.jpg        JPEG image       (image/jpg)
file.jpeg       JPEG image       (image/jpg)
</pre>
</blockquote>

If no file suffix is supplied, the file type is set to plaintext.

<p>
If the URL supplied to <tt>swill_handle()</tt> is prefixed with the special string <tt>"stdout:"</tt>,
SWILL captures all output printed to <tt>stdout</tt> while executing the handler function and returns it
as part of the web page.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void foo() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
}

int main() {
    ...
    swill_handle("stdout:foo.txt", foo, 0);
    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<P>
The capturing of <tt>stdout</tt> also works in applications where you might want to capture the output of
a system command.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void getdir() {
    system("ls -l");
}
...
int main() {
   ...
   swill_handle("stdout:getdir", getdir, 0);
   ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Using <tt>system()</tt> you could implement your own CGI mechanism.
However, be aware that executing system commands is also a significant
security risk---make sure you never pass any sort of user input to
such an operation (otherwise the user might be able to execute
arbitrary shell commands).


<p>
The <tt>clientdata</tt> argument of handler functions is used to pass user-defined data.  This would
be used if you wanted to pass an object to a handler function.   For example, suppose your program
had the ability to make scientific plots and you wanted to provide a variety of web-pages.  To do this,
you might write some code that looked like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void make_plot(FILE *f, Plot3D *plot) {
    ...
    make_plot(plot);
    write_image(plot,f);
    ...
}

int main() {
    ...
    Plot3D *kinetic = KineticEnergyPlot();
    Plot3D *velocity = VelocityPlot();
    ...
    swill_handle("ke.gif", make_plot, kinetic);
    swill_handle("vel.gif", make_plot, velocity);
    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Files and directories</h2>

If necessary, SWILL can be programmed to return existing files.  The following functions can be used:

<p>
<b><tt>swill_file(const char *url, const char *filename)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Adds a single file to the server.  <tt>url</tt> is the name of the document in HTTP requests.
<tt>filename</tt> is a pathname that is relative to the current working directory
of the program.   If <tt>filename</tt> is NULL, then <tt>url</tt> is used for the filename.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>swill_directory(const char *dirname)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets the document root directory to <tt>dirname</tt>.  If this
function is used, it allows SWILL to serve an entire directory of
files.  Whenever an incoming request is received and the request
doesn't match the name of an existing handler or file, this directory
is searched.  Only one directory can be registered with the server at
any given time.  Furthermore, to prevent abuse, certain pathname
restrictions are enforced.  Specifically, web requests involving paths
with special pathname components of "." and ".." are handled as
errors. </blockquote>

<h2>Argument conversion and form variables</h2>

In many applications, it is useful to be able to receive variables
that were supplied on HTML forms.  For example, you might have a web page that asks
a user to input some values such as this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;form action="gcd.txt" method=GET&gt;
X : &lt;input type=text name=x width=5&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Y : &lt;input type=text name=y width=5&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Submit : &lt;input type=submit&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

When the form is submitted, values for x and y will be supplied along with the request.  To receive
these variables in a handler function, the following functions can be used:

<p>
<b><tt>char *swill_getvar(const char *name)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Returns a HTTP variable <tt>name</tt> as a string.  If no such variable exists, returns NULL.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_getargs(const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Parses and returns a collection of form variables.  <tt>fmt</tt> is a special format string that
specifies the names and types of the arguments.    Returns 0 on failure, 1 on success.
<p>
</blockquote>

The <tt>swill_getargs()</tt> is more powerful and is used as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
void gcd(FILE *f) {
   int x, y;
   if (!swill_getargs("i(x)i(y)",&x,&y)) {
       fprintf(f,"Error. Please supply x and y.\n");
   } else {
       /* Compute gcd */
       ...
   }
}</pre>
</blockquote>

In the example, the format string <tt>"i(x)i(y)"</tt> specifies two integer values
named x and y respectively.  The following format codes are currently recognized:

<blockquote>
<pre>
fmt code           C datatype
------------       ---------------------------------
i(name)            signed int
l(name)            signed long
h(name)            signed short
b(name)            signed char (as a number)
I(name)            unsigned int
L(name)            unsigned long
H(name)            unsigned short
B(name)            unsigned char (as a number)
f(name)            float
d(name)            double
s(name)            char *
p(name)            void * (from an unsigned int)
</pre>
</blockquote>

In addition, a vertical bar "|" can be used in the format string to indicate the start of optional
arguments. 

<p>
Here is a more complicated example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
char *name;
char *email;
char *address;
int   age;
...
if (!swill_getargs("s(name)s(email)s(address)|i(age)",
                    &name, &email, &address, &age)) {
   fprintf(f,"Error. Missing arguments.\n");
} else {
   /* Whatever */
   ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>SWILL I/O functions</h2>

Normally, SWILL output is produced using standard functions such as <tt>printf()</tt> or <tt>fprintf()</tt>.  However,
SWILL also provides its own implementation of these functions:

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_printf(const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b><br>
<b><tt>int swill_fprintf(FILE *f, const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b><br>
<b><tt>int swill_vprintf(const char *fmt, va_list ap)</tt></b><br>
<b><tt>int swill_vfprintf(const char *fmt, va_list ap)</tt></b><br>

<P>
The operation of these functions is identical to their counterparts in the C library.  However, there is one minor enhancement.
Specifically, the SWILL I/O functions can optionally accept an encoding parameter.  This is sometimes useful
when producing HTML code from a handler function.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
swill_fprintf(f,"foo.html?name=<b>%(url)s</b>&address=<b>%(url)s</b>", name, address);
</pre>
</blockquote>

Notice the use of the special <tt>%(url)s</tt> format specifier.  When
used, the resulting output is formatted to produce a proper URL
encoding.  For example, a string such as "Brian Ward" will be turned
into "Brian+Ward" and special characters will be converted into escape
codes.

<p>
Currently, two encoding schemes are available:

<p>
<b><tt>%(url)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Formats text so that it is safe to include in a URL as might appear as part of a hyperlink in an
HTML document.  Spaces are replaced by "+" and special symbols are replaced by escape codes.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>%(pre)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Formats text so that it is safe to include in an HTML preformatted text section (&lt;pre&gt;).
Special characters such as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; are replaced by HTML sequences &amp;lt;,
&amp;gt;, and &amp;amp; respectively.
</blockquote>

<p>
Sometimes, you might want to generate a hyperlink to a URL along with optional arguments.  To do this,
the following function can be used:

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_printurl(FILE *f, const char *url, const char *fmt, ...)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Produce a URL of the form "<tt>url?args</tt>".  <tt>url</tt> is the
URL to use in the link.   <tt>fmt</tt> is a argument format string that is identical to that
used by <tt>swill_getargs()</tt>.</blockquote>

<p>
Here is an example of using <tt>swill_printurl()</tt>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
char *name  = "John Doe";
char *email = "john@doe.gov";
int  age    = 13;
...

fprintf(f,"&lt;a href=\"");
swill_printurl(f,"profile.html","s(name)s(email)i(age)", name, email, age);
fprintf(f,"\"&gt;User profile</a>");
</pre>
</blockquote>

It might come as no great surprise that there is some relationship
between <tt>swill_getargs()</tt> and <tt>swill_printurl()</tt>.  One
function is used to receive HTTP arguments whereas the other function
is used to print URLs that contain arguments.  If you're clever, you can
use this to pass data between web pages or as a simple mechanism for
remote procedure call.

<P>When a log file has been supplied to SWILL, output can be generated
using the following function:

<p>
<b><tt>int swill_logprintf(const char *fmt, ...);</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Produces output in the SWILL log file (if any).  If no file was first supplied using
<tt>swill_log()</tt>, this function does nothing.  
</blockquote>

<h2>HTTP Headers</h2>

In certain cases, you might want to retrieve or set HTTP headers
on each request.  For instance, when a server receives a request,
it typically looks like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
GET /foo.html HTTP/1.0
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.73 [en] (X11; U; SunOS 5.8 sun4u)
Pragma: no-cache
Host: schlitz:8080
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/png, */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1,*,utf-8
</pre></blockquote>

The headers are the lines following the initial request lines.  To retrieve
a header, use the following function:

<P>
<b><tt>char *swill_getheader(const char *name)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Returns HTTP header <tt>name</tt>.   If the header doesn't exist,
returns NULL.  <tt>name</tt> is case-insensitive. 
</blockquote>

Here is an example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
char *host = swill_getheader("host");
char *useragent = swill_getheader("user-agent");
</pre>
</blockquote>

To set a header in the outgoing data, use the following:

<P>
<b><tt>void swill_setheader(const char *name, const char *value)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets an HTTP header value in the outgoing data.  No interpretation of <tt>name</tt> or <tt>value</tt> is made.  This simply produces an output string of the form
"<tt>name: value</tt>" in the header section of the HTTP response.
</blockquote>

Under normal use, it is probably not necessary to read or set the HTTP headers.
However, this capability is provided for the sake of power users.

<p>
If you ever need to change the HTTP response code, use the following
function:

<P>
<b><tt>void swill_setresponse(const char *resp)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Sets the HTTP response code.  <tt>resp</tt> is a string such as
<tt>"404 File not found"</tt> or <tt>"501 Not implemented"</tt>.
Under normal conditions, you probably do not need to use this function.
</blockquote>

<h2>Security and reliability</h2>

Since SWILL does not provide support for secure HTTP or encryption, it
is probably not appropriate for applications that require a high degree
of security.  However, SWILL does provide support for both HTTP basic 
authentication and IP filtering.

<p>
Basic authentication is set using the following function:

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_user(const char *username, const char *passwd)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Enables basic authorization.  Once called, all subsequent accesses
will require a username and password.  May be called more than once to
register different users.  In basic authorization, the user name and
password are essentially sent in clear-text in HTTP requests.
Therefore, you should not use a sensitive password or your login
password with this function. 
</blockquote>

<p>
IP filters can be set using the following functions:

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_deny(const char *ip)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Adds an IP address to the deny list.   If an incoming connection is
received from this address, the network connection is immediately
closed.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><tt>void swill_allow(const char *ip)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Adds an IP address to the allow list.  If an address is allowed, it
takes precedence over any address that might be denied using
<tt>swill_deny()</tt>.  Also, calling <tt>swill_allow()</tt> 
implicitly causes swill to deny all accesses except for those
supplied to this function.
</blockquote>

The IP filters use substring matching on the dotted-numerical representation of
an IP address.  Here are some examples:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/* Only allow connections from 128.135.11.44 */
swill_allow("128.135.11.44");  
 
/* Allow connections from a subnet */
swill_allow("128.135.11.");

/* Deny connections from a bad machine */
swill_deny("128.135.11.13");

/* Deny connections from a subnet */
swill_deny("128.135.4.");

/* Deny connections from everywhere */
swill_deny("");
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since SWILL is a single-threaded web-server, a number of mechanisms
are in place to help prevent reliability problems.  First, SWILL will
automatically close a connection whenever requests appear to be
malformed or suspicious.  Second, timeouts are used to help prevent
lock-ups due to unresponsive clients or clients that open connections,
but which don't send any data.  This timeout is set to 10 seconds by default.
However, it can be changed using the following function:

<p>
<b><tt>swill_timeout(int seconds)</tt></b>
<blockquote>
Set the timeout tolerance for data transmission. Read/write operations
that take longer than this time will result in a termination of the connection.
</blockquote>

<h2>Using MPI</h2>

Using SWILL to add a webserver to an MPI program should not be difficult. That being said, SWILL has been designed with a certain execution model in mind (SPMD style programs, to be precise), and it may take slightly more to make it work with a parallel application that is doing funny things. The most important rule of thumb is this: most <tt>swill_*()</tt> calls  are made within a global context. That is to say, they should either be in a part of the code that is not rank-dependent, or they should be duplicated across rank-dependent parts of the code so that they are called by everyone.
<p>
It is probably easier to explain this using a very simple example: <p>

<blockquote>
<tt>
<pre>
#include "mpi.h"
#include "swill.h"

int r;
void foo()
{ printf("foo %d\n", r); }

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD,&r);

swill_init(8887);
swill_handle("stdout:foo.txt", foo, NULL);

while(1){
        sleep(5);
        swill_poll();
}
return 0;
}
</pre>
</tt>
</blockquote>

To begin with, SWILL expects the host application to initialize MPI (<tt>MPI_Init()</tt>). If the user doesn't do it, SWILL will not do it for her. 
<p>
Secondly, <tt>swill_init()</tt> must be called. In this case it gets
called in code that is not rank-dependent -- indeed, the whole example
is rank-independent. If there are other rank-dependent
initializations that need to be performed, then <tt>swill_init()</tt>
can be called along with them, so long as it has been called on every
node before any other <tt>swill_*()</tt> call.
<p>
Thirdly, <tt>swill_handle()</tt> gets called, also in a rank-independent context, to register a function callback. 
<p>
Then we enter our loop, which in this case performs no computation. Again in a rank-independent context, we call <tt>swill_poll()</tt>. 
<p>
What happens under the hood when <tt>swill_poll()</tt> is called is this (let's call the node with rank == 0 the "master node"): 
<ul>
<li> the master node checks for a pending connection. 
<ul>
<li>If there is no pending connection, all nodes are instructed to continue with their computation, and we're done. 
<li>If there is a connection other than an authentication request or a request for a file from the filesystem, the master node broadcasts it to all nodes.
<li>If authentication is being requested, the master node authenticates the user, instructs the rest to continue, and we're done.
<li>If a file from the filesystem is requested, again, the master node authenticates the user, instructs the rest to continue, and we're done.
</ul>
<li> all nodes compute the desired output. In rank order, each node sends back the resulting output to the master.
<li> the master collects the output in rank order, and writes it to the socket. Computation continues where it left off. 
</ul>

So, then, in an MPI application, calling a <tt>swill_poll()</tt> is equivalent to performing a barrier synchronization. That is because the master node has to broadcast at least one piece of information, i.e. whether there is a pending request that requires every node's output, or not.
<p>
Notice that no formatting or designation of output by rank number or anything of that sort is done. This sort of functionality is up to the user to implement.
