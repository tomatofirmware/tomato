CHANGES

2/21/2002: beazley
           Modified the build process.  SWILL now builds as a shared
           library libswill.so.  An optional I/O filter library
           can be built in the Source/Filter library.  If compiled,
           this creates a library libswillc.so.

*(TL) added --with-mpi=<mpi_root>
	currently only works with argument, must collect standard locations
	and make --with-mpi[=mpi_root]
