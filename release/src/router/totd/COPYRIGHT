On Copyright and Licencing
==========================

This document contains the copyright notices and licenses that apply
to the collection of files that constitute the totd program. As some parts
of totd have been produced by other authors than the main author of totd,
different parts (files) of totd are copyrighted by multiple authors and
are covered by multiple licences. Each individual file lists its copyright
holders, but not the corresponding licenses that apply to it. These licences
can be found below. Note that some apply only to (very small) parts of totd,
and that all licenses are of the `BSD style'.

Note that the SWILL library has its own license. See the SWILL-0.1/
subdirectory for more information. Including the SWILL library into
totd is optional.
