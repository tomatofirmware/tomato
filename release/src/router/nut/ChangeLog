	* drivers/mge-hid.c: Improve Eaton ABM support for USB/HID units  As
	  per clarifications from David G. Miller (Eaton ABM expert) and
	  customers request, when ABM is enabled, we now both publish the
	  following as per the ABM information: - the 5 status bits
	  {charging, discharging, floating, resting, off} under
	  battery.charger.status - the 2 historical status bits {CHRG,
	  DISCHRG} under ups.status When ABM is disabled, we just publish the
	  2 historical status bits {CHRG, DISCHRG} under ups.status, as per
	  UPS.PowerSummary.PresentStatus.{Charging,Discharging}, as done
	  previously

	* conf/ups.conf.sample, docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c,

	  implementation  The previous commit was suffering a number of
	  issues. The present commit fixes these, along with adding more
	  documentation and a better and more understandable implementation
	  code. Thanks to Daniele Pezzini for the thorough review  Closes:

	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c, drivers/dstate.h,
	  drivers/main.c: Implement synchronous driver flag  As per issue
	  #197, NUT drivers work by default in asynchronous mode. This means
	  that all data are pushed by the driver on the communication socket
	  to upsd (Unix socket on Unix, Named pipe on Windows) without
	  waiting for these data to be actually consumed.  With some HW, such
	  as ePDUs, that can produce a lot of data, asynchronous mode may
	  cause some congestion, resulting in the socket to be full, and the
	  driver to appear as not connected.  By enabling the 'synchronous'
	  flag, the driver will wait for data to be consumed by upsd, prior
	  to publishing more.  This can be enabled either globally or per
	  driver.

2015-04-07  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* scripts/systemd/nut-server.service.in: Do not Require systemd nut-
	  driver for nut-server  Put the Requires=nut-driver.service in
	  comment for nut-server systemd unit file. Thus we don't require
	  drivers to be successfully started! This was a change of behavior
	  compared to init SysV, and could prevent from accessing
	  successfully started drivers, or at least to audit a system

	* data/cmdvartab, drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: drivers/bcmxcp:
	  advanced features  Closes: #158  Added setvar function exec result
	  parsing  Add command to turn load on after shutdown.stayoff and
	  shutdown.return.  Outlet control changed. Outlet control via
	  commands "outlet.n.load.on/off" like in other drivers. Variable
	  outlet.n.staus now only for reading.  Some code changes in
	  outlet.n.shutdown.return command -  now supporting more than 3
	  outlets (up to 9).  Add descriptions to new and some old variables
	  and commands.  Add "bypass.start" command, for enabling bypass. For
	  returning in On-Line mode exec "load.on" command.  Additional
	  checks of UPS vars. Now add zero var only if it could be changed.

2015-04-01  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/eaton-mib.c: Workaround input.{power,realpower} for Eaton
	  ePDUs  Add variable declarations to handle missing
	  input.{power,realpower} on Eaton ePDUs G2 and G3 1phase. On 3phase,
	  these variables point at SNMP OIDs that sum up the 3 phases
	  information. These OIDs should also be present on 1phase, however
	  it's actually not the case. So simply duplicate the L1 declaration

	* drivers/powerware-mib.c: Implement battery.charger.status for Eaton

	* drivers/mge-hid.c: Implement Eaton ABM support for USB/HID units
	  Add support for Eaton Advanced Battery Monitoring, for USB/HID
	  units. Information are provided through the new
	  battery.charger.status. For now, at least, when ABM is enabled, the
	  historic CHRG and DISCHRG flags are not published anymore in

	  UPSes incorrectly report the 'Shutdown Active' bit (7th bit of the
	  'status byte') as always on (=1), consequently making the driver
	  believe the UPS is nearing a shutdown (and, as a result, ups.status
	  always contains FSD). To workaround this issue, add a new
	  'ignoresab' flag that makes the driver do just what its name tells
	  (IGNORE Status Active Bit) skipping the relative item in qx2nut
	  tables.  References: - http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail

	  low (in minutes) - battery.energysave.realpower: to switch off the
	  UPS if running on battery and power consumption on UPS output is
	  lower than this value (expressed in Watts). Note that documentation
	  in nut-names.txt and cmdvartab was limited to difference with an
	  upcoming branch merge, that will add the others
	* drivers/mge-hid.c: Align Energy Saving variable names  Change
	  ups.load.energysave to battery.energysave.load, to be coherent with

	  making the UPS turn on the load as soon as power is back.
	* drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: nutdrv_qx: fix command handling in 'fuji'

	* drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: nutdrv_qx: prevent a vicious loop when
	  unexpected answers happen  If a 'QX_FLAG_QUICK_POLL' item gets an
	  unexpected (non-empty) answer and, after returning from
	  'qx_ups_walk()', it is not followed by at least one item using a
	  different 'command', the driver will loop endlessly using the same
	  'broken' answer instead of trying to get a new one from the UPS. To
	  solve this issue, make sure to have an empty 'previous_item' when
	  starting 'qx_ups_walk()'. Also, bail out of 'qx_ups_walk()' when a
	  'QX_FLAG_QUICK_POLL' item can't be preprocessed properly through
	  'ups_infoval_set()'.

	  https://wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions for more
	  information.
	* scripts/python/module/PyNUT.py: Fix error when raising without an

	  poll the UPS for 'vendor' informations as they are not really

	  Add new 'Q1' subdriver. This subdriver implements the same protocol
	  as the one used by the 'megatec' subdriver minus the vendor (I) and
	  ratings (F) queries. In the claim function: - it doesn't even try
	  to get 'vendor' informations (I) - it checks only status (Q1),
	  through 'input.voltage' variable Therefore it should be able to
	  work even if the UPS doesn't support vendor/ratings *and* the user
	  doesn't use the 'novendor'/'norating' flags, as long as: - the UPS
	  replies a Q1-compliant answer (i.e. not necessary filled with all
	  of the Q1-required data, but at least of the right length and with
	  not available data filled with some replacement character) - the
	  UPS reports a valid input.voltage (used in the claim function) -
	  the UPS reports valid status bits (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th are the
	  mandatory ones)  This commit reintroduces a functionality of the
	  blazer subdrivers that was lost because now, in order to tell
	  whether a device is supported by a subdriver or not, if the user
	  doesn't call the driver with the 'novendor' flag, both the status
	  (Q1) and the vendor (I/FW?) queries are needed (that's to better
	  discern the subdrivers).  Reference:

	  Provide retry options for upsdrvctl and driver(s)  As recently seen
	  in Debian (bugs #694717 and #677143), it may be required to have
	  upsdrvctl retrying to start the driver in case of failure.  More
	  specifically, a mix of init system (V and systemd), udev and USB
	  device(s) can result in the /dev entry not being available at
	  driver startup, thus resulting in a general failure to start NUT.
	  This commit provides at least a way to overcome this issue. A more
	  suitable  solution will require more work on NUT design.  This
	  patch if based on Arnaud Quette proposal

	  docs/new-drivers.txt, drivers/Makefile.am, drivers/al175.c: al175:
	  updated driver, please restore it  Back in 2005 I was young and
	  idealistic, that's why you finally marked al175 as 'broken', but
	  now I understand your points (some) and that in NUT you need good
	  portability.  So this time I've checked that al175 compiles with
	  CC="gcc -std=c89 -pedantic", and CC="gcc -std=c99 -pedantic"  Also,
	  I've tried to clean-up the driver based on feedback from 2009, but
	  unfortunately I no longer have hardware to test and will not have
	  any in foreseable future, so the driver was reworked to meet the
	  project code quality criteria, without testing on real hardware.
	  Some bugs may have crept in.  Changes since last posting in 2009:
	  - patch rebased on top of current master (v2.6.5-400-g214c442); -
	  added reference to COMLI communication protocol document; - status
	  decode errors go to log, instead of setting non-conformant status
	  like "?T", "?OOST", etc.  For such errors new loglevel is
	  allocated; - "High Battery" status is back; - converted tracing
	  macros to direct use of upsdebugx and numbers 1,2,3,4 for loglevels
	  as requested (but now lines got longer because of explicit __func__
	  usage); - lowered usage of other macros (e.g. REVERSE_BITS
	  inlined); - alarm(3) is not used anymore - instead whole I/O
	  transaction time budget is maintained manually; - man page
	  converted to asciidoc and supported variables list is merged into
	  it;  - upsdebug_ascii moved to common.c and to separate patch.
	  ~~~~  Changes since al175 was removed from NUT tree in 2008:  -
	  alloca was eliminated through the help of automatic variables -
	  debugging/tracing were reworked to (almost always) use NUT builtins
	  - al175 now uses 3 debug levels for (1=user-level info, 2=protocol
	  debugging, 3=I/O tracing)  - rechecked
	  http://eu1.networkupstools.org/doc/2.2.0/developers.html and
	  applied where apporpiate  Also  > This driver does not support
	  upsdrv_shutdown(), which makes > it not very useful in a real world
	  application. This alone > warrants 'experimental' status, but for
	  the below mentioned > reasons (to name a few), it's flagged
	  'broken' instead.  Yes, at present shutdown is not supported, and
	  unfortunately now I don't have AL175 hardware at hand, so that I
	  can't write it and verify the implementation.  I've marked the
	  driver as DRV_EXPERIMENTAL, although it was tested by us as part of
	  our systems to work OK for more than three years in production
	  environment on ships (and we don't need shutdown there -- in
	  critical situations the system has to operate as long as possible,
	  untill the battery is empty)  Also, all of the previous issues
	  listed below are now fixed in this al175 version:  - ‘return’
	  with a value, in function returning void (2x) - anonymous variadic
	  macros were introduced in C99 - C++ style comments are not allowed
	  in ISO C90 - ISO C forbids braced-groups within expressions (5x) -
	  ISO C90 forbids specifying subobject to initialize (16x) - ISO C99
	  requires rest arguments to be used (18x)  Yes, "All the world is
	  not an x86 Linux box," and I've tried to make all the world happy.
	  Please apply.  Thanks, Kirill.
	* common/common.c, docs/developers.txt, include/common.h: common:
	  upsdebug_ascii() - to dump a message in ascii  For debugging ASCII-
	  based protocols with control characters (e.g. COMLI) it is handy to
	  dump messages not in hex, but in ascii with human readable codes.
	  Add utility function to do it.

	  Add Mecer subdiver (blzr protocol=mecer)  A subdriver covering an
	  idiom similar to the one used by the megatec subdriver, but with
	  these peculiarities: - if a command/query is rejected or invalid,
	  the UPS will reply '(NAK\r' - if a command succeeds, the UPS will
	  reply '(ACK\r'

	* docs/website/scripts/nut_jquery.js: HCL JavaScript: make key case-
	  insensitive  Also special-case the spelling change for Tripp Lite.
	  TODO: make the value matching case-insensitive as well.
	* docs/website/scripts/nut_jquery.js: HCL JavaScript: update the USB-
	  matching code  Slightly more accurate, but later on we should
	  really track the connection type as a first-class attribute for
	  each entry in the HCL. Matching the driver name is brittle.
	* docs/website/scripts/nut_jquery.js, tools/nut-hclinfo.py: HCL
	  generation: don't combine driver names  The Python and JavaScript
	  code for generating the HCL was combining adjacent drivers even
	  when the support level was different. This clutters up the driver
	  list a bit, but presents a more accurate picture of support levels.

	  align text
	* drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Reformat code, remove tabs in the middle
	  of lines. No code changes  After re-reading the developer code
	  style guide, use spaces and not tabs in the middle of lines to
	  align text
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Refactor code, use if-else if rather than
	  4 if statements

2013-08-08  Alf Høgemark <alf@i100.no>

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Add parameter to nut_find_infoval to
	  control debug output  We do not want debug output if
	  nut_find_infoval does not find a mapped value in all cases. For
	  example, when a command byte is not mapped to a instcmd, we do not
	  want debug output.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Remove
	  PW_UPDATE_POWER_SOURCE_STATUS_COMMAND, it seems very unlikely to be
	  used
	* drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Cosmetic changes constant definitions. No
	  code changes.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Use command map to
	  control which instcmd are supported  Use the command map info
	  retrieved from UPS to list all commands supported by the UPS at
	  debug level 2. Use the info from command map to set up which
	  instcmd the UPS supports.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Use info_lkp_t structure for mapping
	  topology info  Make code simpler by using the info_lkp_t structure
	  for mapping value from topology block to text presented to user as
	  ups.description
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Cosmetic commentary fixes and remove some
	  empty lines. No code changes
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Output unsupported alarms on debug level
	  3, not level 2  The supported alarms in alarm map is outputted at
	  debug level 2. The unsupported alarms should be outputted at debug
	  level 3, it is not that interesting. Also remove debug outputted
	  empty line after table heading line for meter map and alarm map.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Refactor code for setting which alarms
	  are supported, to avoid code duplication  Refactor the code which
	  checks the alarm map for supported alarms, by making a new method
	  which checks the alarm bit to see if the alarm is supported.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Only include ups.serial and device.part
	  if they have a value  Only set info about ups.serial and
	  device.part if the UPS actually report useful info for these.
	  Remove the handling of space characters as meaning string
	  termination for ups.serial, this is not done for part number, and
	  according to bcmxcp spec are these both 16 byte ascii text
	  messages. Move Nominal output frequence handling up, placing it
	  just below Nominal output voltage

	* docs/man/index.txt, docs/man/voltronic_ser.txt,
	  docs/man/voltronic_usb.txt: voltronic* documentation updates  - Add
	  to man page index - Reword a few sections - Fix typos - Comment out
	  USB section in voltronic_ser.txt  Long-term, we should probably
	  figure out a better way to maintain two parallel driver pages like
	  this. The blazer man page is the same for both, with .so links for
	  the man pages, but then you have USB info in a serial driver page.
	  For now, voltronic_usb.txt is just a copy of voltronic_ser.txt with
	  a few _ser-to-_usb replacements.

	* docs/man/upsc.txt, docs/man/upscmd.txt, docs/man/upsrw.txt:
	  Complete upsclient commands usage note  Add a note for scripting
	  usage, for upsc, upscmd and upsrw, to state the obvious: only
	  consider the output from stdout for data requested. stderr may
	  contain error messages, which can disrupt your script execution.
	  Address the second task and closes Github issue #30
	* clients/upsclient.c: Fix a minor regression in upsclient output
	  NSS support has introduced a minor regression in upsclient output.
	  Clients such as upsc, upscmd and upsrw were particularly affected.
	  This patch restores a default behavior similar to prior versions.
	  However, "-v" option remains to be implemented.  Address the first

	* clients/upsclient.c: Fix nut-scanner crash on nut server scan,
	  upscli_sslinit calls upscli_readline which might calls
	  upscli_disconnect in case of error. upscli_disconnect frees
	  ups->host and set it to NULL, so it is illegal to use ups->host

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Use defined constants in setvar, and
	  handle BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST  Use the defined
	  constants from header file, instead of magic numbers in setvar
	  method. Add handling of BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST.
	  Report upsdrv_comm_good on successful execution of setvar to UPS.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Add handling of
	  BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST and others in ACK block
	  Add support for handling more return statuses when exeucting
	  commands, the most important being
	  BCMXCP_RETURN_ACCEPTED_PARAMETER_ADJUST, which means the command
	  was executed. The others added all handles cases where command was
	  not executed, but you now get a more detailed entry in log as to
	  why it was not executed.

	  shutdown.return instcmd, and then proceed with shutdown.stayoff if
	  the shutdown.return failed. This seems to be in line with what the
	  usbhid driver does.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: report upsdrv_comm_good at successful
	  execution of instcmd
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Return more specific error codes from
	  instcmd  Use the available STAT_INSTCMD_FAILED and
	  STAT_INSTCMD_INVALID as return value from the instcmd method when
	  applicable, instead of always returning STAT_INSTCMD_UNKNOWN or -1.

2013-07-03  Alf Høgemark <alf@i100.no>

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: use command map if

	* drivers/bestfcom.c: bestfcom: Use fc.idealbvolts for calculating
	  percent charge  'I have a Best Ferrups 3.1KVA and I noticed that
	  the percent battery voltage reported from upsc never gets above
	  69.9%.  I believe there is a mistake in the driver.  The battery
	  percentage is calculated based on the High Battery Alarm Setpoint
	  (59.6V) instead of the Ideal Voltage which is about 54V (4
	  batteries x 13.6V).  I examined the source code and found that the
	  variable fc.fullvolts is the result of querying parameter 67 from
	  the UPS.  This parameter is defined per Ferrups Tip 503 as: "The
	  battery voltage at which the UPS sound a High Battery alarm"  A
	  better value to use in determining the percent battery voltage
	  would be fc.idealbvolts which is calculated in the driver source...
	  I propose the following patch to fix the battery.charge (% battery
	  full) reading.'  Ref:

	* docs/man/apcsmart.txt, drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: allow users to
	  select non-canonical tty mode  The main reason behind this addition
	  is windows compatibility, see
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762  IGNCR
	  has been readded earlier in commit
	  20c52bee77fa0b3ea3c7f8bec25afd103b7ff4a2 - this might be enough to
	  handle windows behavior, but if it's not the case - using non
	  canonical processing (same as is present in apcsmart-old) should
	  solve any pressing issues.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: add device.uptime to vartab

2013-04-26  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: remove

2013-04-15  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: change
	  approach to 2 digit compatibility entries  As reported in
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762 - 2
	  digit values reported through 'b' are really >255V voltage values.
	  So we match whole 00 - FF set as single (fake) compat entry.

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: remove strchr() check from

2013-04-15  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: re-add CR to ignore sets  Despite

	  fashion analogous to IGNCR flag.  See
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762 for
	  rationale.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: add regex format to
	  ambient.0.temperature  'T' might (on older units) also mean "ups
	  uptime", so we want to distinguish that case gracefully. The
	  formats are:  uptime: 000.0 temp: 00.00

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: move variable regex matching
	  into vartab  This also allows us to properly validate (in near
	  future) cases when single apc variable can match multiple nut
	  variables.  Other changes:  - adjust rexhlp() to follow 0 for false
	  and non-0 for true, like in the rest of the functions - remove
	  valid_cmd() as rexhlp() can be used directly with formats in the
	  table; furthermore the warning (in case of failure) could be
	  confusing when we add nut:apc n:1 case

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: implement #311678 (multiple
	  values per variable)  This is a bit more general than the original
	  request.  All variables that return multiple comma-separated
	  values, are added as *.N.* where 1 <= N <= APC_PACK_MAX; the
	  variables are stored with temporary name *.0.* in apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  but only at least 1 and at most 4 are added per update run
	  (superfluous - if any - are removed), with *.0.* placeholder being
	  ignored.  We assume that the particular variables cannot belong to
	  the capability set at the same time (as reported by user) -
	  otherwise we will need a bit more complex handling, including
	  updates to all setvar functions.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: update logging
	  logic / apc_read()  - logging  This mostly adds few macros that
	  implicitly use or pass caller's name (and in case of hard errors,
	  line number). This allows removal of a few "failed" / "succeeded"
	  lines (which in practice don't really happen), for example there is
	  no need for:  upslogx(LOG_ERR, "preread_data: apc_write failed");
	  as any hard error will be reported by apc_write() internally,
	  providing the place and line number it was called at.  Similarly,
	  some upslogx / upsdebugx calls were wrapped in analogous macros to
	  provide caller's name automatically.  Debug levels (-D) were
	  adjusted to require only one letter.  - apc_read()  It's been a bit
	  more scrutinized:  - filling up full caller's buffer is considered
	  an error; shouldn't happen unless the ups is somehow damaged or
	  some model is capable of returning more than 512 bytes in one read
	  (current max I witnessed is around 270 bytes during capability
	  read) - timeout reads (whether it's allowed or not) cannot really
	  have any non-0 count, though sanity check could theoretically be
	  useful in non-canonical mode; commented out code was added for
	  reference
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: enhance prtchr()  So it can handle 4
	  returns with static pointers.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: allow timeout on read in smartmode()
	  As this function is used to "nudge" ups, we should expect it to
	  timeout.  Also avoids extra log spam.

	* data/driver.list.in: HCL: Add support for Lyonn CTB-1200  Add Lyonn
	  CTB-1200 (USB ID 0x0665:0x5161) to the list of blazer_usb supported

	* docs/stable-hcl.txt: Clarify expected report for shutdown testing
	  State explicitly that, for now, a statement that the user has

	  (report from Martin Sarsale)

2012-12-19  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* scripts/HP-UX/makedepot.sh, scripts/HP-UX/nut.psf.in: Use installed

	  factor
	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/Makefile.am, drivers/delta_ups-mib.c,

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add update_info()  No need for almost
	  identical update_info_normal() and update_info_all()
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: two fixups  In poll_data(): we are
	  not supposed to set variable after its (formally impossible)
	  removal  In upsdrv_shutdown(): wrong comparison

2012-12-14  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/powerp-txt.c, drivers/powerpanel.c:
	  Add support for CyberPower OL3000RMXL2U  Add CyberPower

	  version (Alioth patch #313910, from Timothy Pearson)

2012-12-13  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/new-drivers.txt, docs/snmp-subdrivers.txt,
	  scripts/subdriver/gen-snmp-subdriver.sh: Helper script to create
	  SNMP subdrivers stubs  Created a new shell script
	  (scripts/subdriver/gen-snmp-subdriver.sh) to automatically create a
	  "stub" subdriver. This will make it a lot easier and quicker to
	  create subdrivers for snmp-ups. A new documentation chapter has
	  also been added ("How to make a new subdriver to support another
	  SNMP device")
	* drivers/tripplite-hid.c: Add support for newer TrippLite
	  Smart1500LCD  Add newer TrippLite Smart1500LCD (USB ID
	  0x09ae:0x3016) to the list of usbhid-ups supported models (reported
	  by Steve Salier)

2012-12-12  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/mge-hid.c: Fix crash with debug level greater or equal to 2

2012-12-10  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add prtchr() helper  Add prtchr()
	  helper and simplify reporting when we check whether some APC
	  cmd/var character is or isn't printable.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: apc_cmdtab[] fixup  Earlier
	  commit that adjusted regex checks, also changed cmd fields for all
	  instant commands handled by custom functions. We cannot do that, as
	  they are not detected as supported this way.

2012-12-08  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/mge-utalk.c, drivers/mge-utalk.h: Change Martin Loyer's
	  mail address  As per Martin's request.
	* drivers/mge-utalk.c: Improve mge-utalk general behavior  Make two
	  adjustments to improve the general behavior: first, send the double
	  "Z" prior to "Si" command. Second, inter-commands delay has been
	  increased to comply with the specification

2012-12-08  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: serial related stuff a bit more
	  strict  Also:  - apc_flush() now loops with >0 condition (otherwise
	  errored apc_read() might cause inf loop) - ser_comm_good/fail()
	  were kind of missing in write wrappers
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart:
	  sdlist/sdtype/advorder changes  - verify 'advorder' with regex -
	  remove unused defines - as the user is directed towards man page
	  either way (and without it numbers are kind of meaningless), drop
	  SDMAX
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: setup port after variable
	  sanitization in upsdrv_initups()
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: cleanup dstate ok/stale calls
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: getbaseinfo() fixup  In extremely
	  unlikely case of failing write, report it up and act accordingly.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: adjust regex logic  A bit
	  simpler / tighter now.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add var_string_setup()  In theory
	  deprecate_vars() should also consider APC_STRING variables. In
	  practice - we don't have any variables that are both APC_MULTI and
	  APC_STRING - but it's more correct this way, so let's do it.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: cosmetics  - code shuffling,
	  comments, flow - rename query_ups() -> legacy_verify() - add few
	  lines of help directing to man page
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: simplify query_ups() /
	  proto_verification()  Both functions rely now on common variable
	  verificaion function.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add var_verify()  The function will
	  be used in subsequent commit for common verification.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: shuffle two functions  query_ups()
	  and oldapcsetup()
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: simplify query_ups()  This commit
	  changes query_ups() function and makes it rely on the same
	  deprecate_vars() logic that protocol_verify() requires.  We can
	  shorten the code a bit now, and it allows us to do more
	  simplifications in subsequent commits.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add functions informing about
	  [un]supported cmds/vars  In unified fashion, instead of each
	  protocol-verification related function doing it on its own.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: minor tidying up  comments,
	  trivial changes, code shuffling ...
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: remove unused field 'def' from cchar
	  In apc_ser_diff() reporting differences between
	  tcgetattr/tcsetattr, 'def' field was unused (along with related
	  defines).

2012-12-06  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

2012-11-21  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/acknowledgements.txt: Complete Acknowledgements with a Riello

2012-11-20  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* clients/upsclient.h, server/nut_ctype.h: Fix NSS include directives
	  The current NSS include directives (nss/nss.h) were incorrect.
	  These were failing on Redhat systems, and working on some others
	  because of the default include path (reported by Michal Hlavinka,
	  from Redhat)

2012-11-19  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	  docs/man/libnutclient_general.txt, docs/man/libnutclient_misc.txt,
	  docs/man/libnutclient_tcp.txt, docs/man/libnutclient_variables.txt:
	  Fix Buildbot failures on previous commit (man pages)  The merge of
	  the libnutclient branch caused a failure of the 'distcheck-light'
	  test target. Manual pages documentation in this branch uses a
	  mechanism to generate multiple manpages from one source file. This
	  was however conflicting with a Makefile rule, that requires the
	  generated file to have the same name as the source file. Applies
	  the same principle by adding the content of the Header section to
	  the NAME commands list. Also fix a typo error in the Header section
	  of libnutclient_devices

	* scripts/subdriver/gen-usbhid-subdriver.sh: Fix USB HID subdriver
	  generation tool  This tool has not been updated since timestamps

	* docs/man/.gitignore, docs/man/blazer.txt: Fix blazer manual pages
	  generation  to generate blazer, blazer_ser and blazer_usb manual
	  pages. The same manual page is now distributed and available under
	  these 3 names (warning to packagers)
	* docs/man/Makefile.am, docs/man/asciidoc.conf: Fix manpage
	  refmiscinfo attributes and multiple NAME  refmiscinfo attributes
	  were previously specified through asciidoc.conf. This approach
	  prevented from specifying and generating multiple manual pages from
	  a single source. Moreover, manversion (pointing NUT version) was
	  mistyped, and thus omitted. Makefile rules now directly define
	  refmiscinfo through attributes, and allow to solve the long
	  standing blazer / blazer_ser / blazer_usb related issue, and the
	  upcoming libnutclient one

	* data/driver.list.in: HCL: Add support for Apollo 850VA  Add Apollo

	* drivers/tripplite_usb.c: Remove POD ("Plain Old Documentation")

	* docs/website/.gitignore, docs/website/Makefile.am,
	  docs/website/news.txt, docs/website/old-news.txt: Integrate
	  archived news
	* docs/nut-names.txt, drivers/mge-hid.c: Add shutdown ability switch
	  to Eaton units  Eaton HID units (using usbhid-ups or [new,old]mge-
	  shut) were missing a data mapping to allow the change of the
	  shutdown ability switch. The result was that the UPS was not
	  powered off, even if all the protocol commands were sent (reported
	  by Daniel O'Connor)
	* docs/download.txt, docs/website/news.txt: Update Windows package
	  publications for 2.6.5-1
	* docs/man/.gitignore, docs/man/index.txt: Added macosx-ups manual
	  page to the index  Also add generated groff and HTML contents to
	  the list of Subversion ignored files

2012-08-08  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* NEWS, UPGRADING, configure.in, docs/website/news.txt: Final update
	  for 2.6.5 release
	* drivers/.gitignore: Subversion ignored files completion  Mark
	  oldmge-shut binary as Subversion ignored (no functional changes)
	* docs/configure.txt, m4/nut_check_libltdl.m4: Complete libltdl
	  configuration options  Add configure options to add specific cflags
	  (--with-libltdl-includes) and libs (--with-libltdl-libs) for
	  libltdl. This serves at least to point at non standard location, as
	  on FreeBSD (reported by David Durieux)

2012-08-06  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	  NUT from Eaton website hosting  NUT is no more hosted by Eaton.
	  Arnaud Quette (NUT project leader) has taken over NUT hosting on
	  his own, to give NUT back some independance. This effort is also
	  part of a logic to stop crediting Eaton for contributions from
	  others (especially Arnaud Quette, as an individual). The new
	  hosting service is located, as for Arnaud's blog
	  (http://arnaud.quette.fr) on Gandi servers, using PaaS. This will
	  allow more flexibility and automation of the release process

	* configure.in, docs/man/Makefile.am, docs/man/macosx-ups.txt,
	  drivers/Makefile.am, drivers/macosx-ups.c: macosx-ups: new OS X
	  Power Sources meta-driver  Mac OS X provides UPS status information
	  in a format similar to what is shown for laptop batteries. This
	  driver will convert that information into a format compatible with
	  NUT.

2012-08-05  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* drivers/skel.c: Update comments in skel.c  Fixed a typo, and added

	  Alpha650ipE  Add UNITEK Alpha650ipF and Alpha650ipE (USB ID
	  0x0f03:0x0001) to the list of blazer_usb supported models (reported
	  by Pascal MIRALLES)
	* docs/website/projects.txt: Reference Buffalo NAS in Related

	* docs/download.txt, docs/website/news.txt: First NUT virtualization
	  package (VMware ESXI 5.0)  Add the reference to the first NUT
	  virtualization package. This one is currently an external effort to
	  add VMware NUT client for ESXI 5.0. But this support will be part
	  of NUT in the long run

	* data/driver.list.in, docs/man/powercom.txt, drivers/powercom-hid.c:
	  Synchronize Powercom USB documentation and code comments.
	  Apparently, there are at least two different models with the USB
	  VID:PID of 0d9f:0004. This update is based on the following report
	  by Gordon Longland:  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-

	* docs/man/mge-shut.txt: Update mge-shut man page for notification
	  argument.
	* drivers/usbhid-ups.c: Add a "notification" parameter to newmge-shut
	  driver.  It is only here for compatibility with mge-shut driver. It
	  is ignored since we are always using SHUT_SYNC_OFF in libshut.c.

	* drivers/apc-mib.c: APC SNMP MIB update and completion  Add
	  available high precision values, new variables
	  (input.transfer.reason, battery.current.total and ups.test.date),
	  and move ambient.{temperature,humidity}.{high,low} to ambient.1.*,
	  since they relate to alarm threshold of external probe 1 (patch
	  from Hong-Gunn Chew)
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Clarify the use of multiple ambient sensors
	  Multiple sensors can be exposed using the indexed notation.
	  'ambient.*', without index or using '0', relates to the embedded
	  sensor. For example: 'ambient.temperature' represent the embedded
	  sensor temperature. Other sensors (external, communication card,
	  ...) can use indexes from '1' to 'n'. For example:
	  'ambient.1.temperature' for the first external sensor temperature.
	* docs/nut-names.txt: NUT namespace completion  Add two new variables
	  'ups.test.date' and 'battery.current.total'. Also add a note on the
	  'ambient' collection for supporting multiple sensors

	  Oliver Schonefeld)
	* Makefile.am, configure.in, tests/.gitignore, tests/Makefile.am,
	  tests/cpputest.cpp, tests/example.cpp: Add basic infrastructure for

	  libltdl (Libtool dlopen abstraction) since NUT 2.6.3.
	  Documentations have been completed, and nut-scanner build status is
	  now exposed in the build configuration summary
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: Fix publication of driver.version.data  Publish
	  the MIB name and version in driver.version.data, rather than merged
	  into driver.version.internal
	* drivers/netxml-ups.c: Fix publication of driver.version.data
	  netxml-ups subdriver version is to be tracked in
	  driver.version.data, not in driver.version.internal
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Add missing variable driver.version.data  Add
	  variable driver.version.data, to track version of the internal data
	  mapping, for generic drivers (reported by Luiz Angelo Daros de
	  Luca)
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Fix comment for driver.version.internal
	  Drivers internal version are always tracked separately, and stored
	  in driver.version.internal

2012-06-11  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: tcsetattr/tcgetattr addendum  This

	* common/parseconf.c: Fix CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed
	  NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3,  are exposed to
	  crashes when receiving random data from the network.  This issue is
	  related to the way NUT parses characters, especially from the
	  network. Non printable characters were missed from strings
	  operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the buffer, causing
	  an overflow.  Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset Ascii
	  charset from Space to ~  (Reported by Sebastian Pohle, Alioth bug
	  #313636, CVE-2012-2944)

2012-05-16  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: Final fix to the
	  tcsetattr() / tcgetattr() issue  The most likely cause of all
	  spurious differences between what was set on the port with
	  tcsetattr() and what tcgetattr() shows are likely to do with the
	  c_local PENDIN flag, which is a status bit, not a control bit. It
	  will change when there's unread pending input, which can be quite
	  often on an APC UPS.  The right way to compare struct termios
	  values is to clear the status flags _after_ the tcsetattr() and of
	  course after the tcgetattr() call and then compare the result with
	  what was set.  Also set NOKERNINFO, if available, as we don't want
	  the UPS or noise on the line to accidentally trigger status output
	  back to the UPS, and finally make sure IEXTEN is also cleared along
	  with ISIG since it too can cause weird things to happen.  This
	  change also adds some debug code to show any differences in the
	  structures in a logical manner in debug output (and squashes one
	  tiny compiler warning) (patch from Greg A. Woods)
	* docs/config-notes.txt, docs/man/upsmon.txt: Whitespace fixes

	  (0x06da:0x0005) and Innova 3/1 T (0x06da:0x0004) to the list of of
	  blazer_usb and blazer_ser supported models. Innova series are
	  online UPS supporting Q1 for compatibility, and many more commands.
	  Better support, either through blazer_* rewrite or through a new
	  driver, is considered as a future possibility

2012-03-24  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* configure.in, docs/Makefile.am, docs/security.txt,
	  scripts/Makefile.am, scripts/ufw/.gitignore, scripts/ufw/README,
	  scripts/ufw/nut.ufw.profile.in: Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)
	  support  Provide an Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) profile
	  (nut.ufw.profile) to tightly integrate NUT, along with some
	  documentation completion for the Security chapter of the user
	  manual

2012-03-23  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* conf/nut.conf.sample, docs/man/nut.conf.txt: Fix nut.conf
	  documentation and sample file  Since nut.conf is intended to be
	  sourced by shell scripts, spaces must not be added around the equal
	  sign. Fix documentation and sample file to conform to this purpose,
	  and add bold warning (reported by Tim Rice, Alioth bug #312452)
	* clients/upsmon.c, server/upsd.c: Detect duplicate instances of upsd
	  / upsmon  Fix a long standing issue, that is the lack of detection
	  of duplicate upsd / upsmon instances when starting another one of
	  these daemons. This previously resulted in inconsistencies, such as
	  being unable to stop the daemon, due to its .pid file being removed
	  by the newly started instance (last reported by Andrew Min Chang)

2012-03-21  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/libshut.c: Avoid stack corruption on invalid frame  In the
	  protocol, the frame size can be 8 bytes max. That is why the frame
	  buffer is only 8 bytes long. If the frame is corrupted, the size
	  read may be up to 15, which may corrupt the stack while writing
	  into the frame buffer. This patch add a simple sanity check on the
	  size to avoid a crash and enforce protocol limitation.
	* drivers/libshut.c: Fix SHUT variables read (from Arnaud Quette)
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h, drivers/bcmxcp_usb.c: Change
	  timeout for PW9120  Current timeout (1 sec) is too short for
	  PW9120: numerous frames are lost. Setting this to 2 seconds fix
	  this.
	* drivers/libshut.c: Deactivate UPS notification  Currently this
	  driver is ignoring notification by automatically sending NACK when
	  they are received. Nevertheless,this behavior creates communication
	  errors with some UPS (M2200). So this patch completly disable the
	  sending of notification from the UPS. Ideally we should correclty
	  implement notifications managment for optimal performance, but with
	  this patch, at least, communiaton works.
	* drivers/libshut.c: Fix shut notification mask

2012-03-09  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/config-notes.txt: Emphasize special characters
	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/tripplite-hid.c: HP USB UPS completion

	  definitions. This includes new ProductIDs, and few more variables
	  and commands
	* drivers/oneac.h: Remove extraneous comment start

2012-03-08  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* common/parseconf.c, common/upsconf.c, docs/config-notes.txt: More
	  flexible '=' character managment in conf files  This allow to
	  support the following forms : 'foo = bar', 'foo=bar', 'foo =bar'
	  and 'foo= bar'

2012-03-06  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/man/oneac.txt, drivers/oneac.c, drivers/oneac.h: Improve
	  general OneAC support (oneac 0.80)  Improve support for all
	  families of Oneac (EG, ON, OZ and OB), including support for more
	  data and instant commands (patch from Bill Elliot)

2012-03-05  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/blazer.c, drivers/blazer_ser.c, drivers/blazer_usb.c:
	  Guesstimate battery high and low voltages  Add an automatic
	  estimation for high and low voltages, to be able to determine
	  battery charge. This should cover most cases, but a bold mention
	  has been added at driver startup, to inform the user. Driver
	  version (USB and serial) have been bumped to reflect this change
	* drivers/blazer.c: Set 'FSD' status flag upon need  As per the
	  recent decision to allow driver to set 'FSD' status flag, set 'FSD'
	  upon "Shutdown imminent" detection

2012-03-02  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

2012-02-29  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* clients/upsc.c, docs/man/upsc.txt: Client side implementation of
	  "LIST CLIENT"  Implement "LIST CLIENT" in upsc, using "-c <device
	  name>"
	* docs/net-protocol.txt, server/netlist.c: Adjust server side
	  implementation of "LIST CLIENT"  Commands of the "LIST" family have
	  to be coherent with the command name. Ie, "LIST CLIENT" should use
	  the same "CLIENT" prefix, or it will otherwise break client side
	  verification mechanism
	* server/netlist.c: Adjust "LIST CLIENTS" implementation  Adjust
	  "LIST CLIENTS" implementation to be more coherent with other
	  network protocol commands
	* docs/net-protocol.txt: Document new "LIST CLIENTS" command
	* server/upsd.c, server/upsd.h: Remove upsd "info" command  Adjust
	  initial "LIST CLIENTS" commit, by removing the upsd "info" command,
	  which is not suitable, and redundant with the "LIST CLIENT" command
	  of the network protocol  [Fixed compilation error]

2012-02-29  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* scripts/python/module/PyNUT.py: Add support for LIST CLIENTS, etc.
	  to PyNUT.  Patch by Rene Martín Rodríguez <rmrodri@ull.edu.es>.
	  Merged with typo fixes in repository.  Covers LIST CLIENTS, FSD,

2012-02-28  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/liebert-hid.c: UPower optimization  Always spell
	  manufacturer names the same way across the various USB drivers.
	  This avoids duplication of manufacturer entries in
	  scripts/upower/95-upower-hid.rules, during automatic generation

2012-02-27  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/cps-hid.c: Add support for CyberPower
	  OR700LCDRM1U  Add CyberPower OR700LCDRM1U (0x0764:0x0601) to the
	  list of usbhid-ups supported models (reported by Brian McCann)

2012-02-22  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: drivers/apcsmart.c: setvar_string() and
	  apc_write_long() bugfixes  setvar_string() couldn't function
	  properly, due to the use of wrong variable.  Not associated with
	  any bugreport (reported directly to email).
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: drivers/apcsmart.c: make
	  tcsetattr()/tcgetattr() difference not fatal  This is follow up
	  from earlier bug report (#313395). Earlier commit should have fixed
	  the issue, but the original submitter never commented on it.  Just
	  in case - instead of making it fatal, we only log the issue.

2012-02-20  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c: Better handling
	  of Net-SNMP AES PrivProtocol  Handle smartly issues related to Net-
	  SNMP support and declaration of AES PrivProtocol

2012-02-19  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: Don't allocate storage for
	  variables in snmp-ups.h  The header files should declare variables
	  as extern, and they should be allocated in only one .c file (not
	  all of the files which include the .h file). While this is not an
	  immediate problem when only one .c file includes the .h file, it
	  still should be fixed in case that changes in the future.  Patch by
	  Daniel Macks: http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fink/experimen
	  tal/dmacks/finkinfo/nut.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: Don't allocate storage for
	  variables in bcmxcp.h  The header files should declare variables as
	  extern, and they should be allocated in only one .c file (not all
	  of the files which include the .h file). This was causing multiple
	  symbol definitions on Mac OS X.  Patch by Daniel Macks: http://fink

	* data/driver.list.in: Support for Dell UPS Network Management Card
	  Add Dell UPS Network Management Card to the list of snmp-ups and
	  netxml-ups supported models. SNMP support currently relies on IETF
	  (RFC-1628) MIB, and not on Dell UPS MIB

2012-02-09  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

2012-01-31  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/bestfortress.c: Add more debug traces  Add more debug
	  traces, again, to work on the checksum corruption issue

2012-01-23  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/mge-mib.c: Clean and complete MGE MIB  Complete MGE MIB for
	  status, variables and commands, using IETF MIB OIDs when needed.
	  Macro have also been replaced by actual numeric OID paths for
	  better clarity.
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: snmp-ups shutdown support
	  snmp-ups now provides support for UPS shutdown, based on usbhid-ups
	  mechanisms (composite commands and fallback). Composite commands
	  are also supported. This means, for example, that if
	  'shutdown.return' is not supported, a combination of 'load.off' +
	  'load.on' may be used.
	* drivers/ietf-mib.c: Fix invalid variable name  Beeper status
	  belongs to the 'ups' data collection
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: Check validity of instant commands before
	  addition  Prior to adding new instant commands, referenced OIDs are
	  now checked for existance. This avoid adding commands that are not
	  supported
	* docs/man/upsmon.txt: Fix upsmon synopsis  Add the missing '-K'
	  (Test for the shutdown flag) to upsmon synopsis (reported by Regid
	  Ichira)

2012-01-20  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in: Support for Riello Netman Plus 102 SNMP Card
	  Add Riello Netman Plus 102 SNMP Card, and attached Sentinel SDL

	* docs/nut-names.txt, drivers/usbhid-ups.c: Adjust ups.start.auto
	  value for shutdown commands  When present, ups.start.auto value
	  needs to be adjusted for shutdown.{return,stayoff} to behave as
	  expected. This is limited to Eaton devices (reported by Rich Wrenn)

2012-01-11  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* UPGRADING: Cleanup garbage line  Remove garbage line that was added
	  by accident during the AsciiDoc branch merge or work
	* tools/nut-scanner/Makefile.am, tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-init.c,
	  tools/nut-scanner/scan_nut.c: Move libupsclient to weak runtime
	  dependencies  libupsclient, as other libraries used by nut-scanner,
	  is now a weak runtime dependency, through the use of lt_dl*()
	  functions. This means that libupsclient is not anymore required,
	  but only suggested. This should also solve the distcheck-light
	  compilation on Aix (on behalf of Frédéric Bohe, from Eaton)

2012-01-10  Michal Hlavinka <mhlavink@redhat.com>

	* drivers/dstate.c: do not forget to check send_to_one return value
	  send_to_one free()s connection, we can't use it after failure.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: do not call getinfo twice, use returned value for
	  parsing  result was stored, but never used. Another dstate_getinfo
	  call was used instead of stored value. Probably result of copy-
	  paste.
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_xml_http.c: do not use unterminated string
	  in strlen  recvfrom returns raw data without null termination, this
	  string can't be used in strlen. Use number of recieved bytes
	  returned by recvfrom instead of strlen.
	* clients/upssched.c: do not send garbage on retry  because write and
	  read commands shared one buffer, on retry we did not send command
	  again, but last read data
	* drivers/tripplite_usb.c: prevent buffer overflow in hexascdump
	  haxascdump uses fixed size static buffer, but it had no checks to
	  assure result can fit into that buffer.
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_nut.c: ups variable was allocated, but not
	  free()d
	* drivers/rhino.c, drivers/solis.c: use automatic time_t variable
	  instead of allocated one  time_t value is small enough to be
	  automatic variable instead of allocated one. It eliminates risk we
	  forget to free it again.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: do not forget to free pTmp  even if len is zero,
	  pTmp should be freed
	* drivers/mge-utalk.c: prevent null pointer dereference in strchr  in
	  some cases p can be null causing null pointer dereference of v
	  (initialized to 0) in strchr command
	* drivers/bcmxcp_usb.c: Fix condition in re-try loop making error
	  checking unreachable  for loop with condition retry <= MAX_TRIES
	  ends with retry = MAX_TRIES+1. This breaks following error check
	  with retry == MAX_TRIES condition, because it's true only in case
	  when last retry actualy succeeded.

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: limit comm-lost spam  In

	* drivers/apcsmart.h: comsetics - adjust tabs [on behalf of Michal
	  Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>]

2011-03-02  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* docs/FAQ.txt: Update Mac power-on FAQ

2011-03-01  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* configure.in, tools/Makefile.am, tools/nut-scanner/.gitignore,
	  tools/nut-scanner/Makefile.am, tools/nut-scanner/nut-scanner.c,
	  tools/nut-usbinfo.pl: First stab to create the nut-scanner (proof
	  of concept),  ...with full USB support, and preliminary support for
	  NUT and Eaton XML/HTTP scan
	* drivers/liebert-esp2.c: Improved Liebert ESP II support, ...
	  ...including UPS shutdown (poweroff), 1 and 3-phase input and
	  output variables, and most input / output / bypass / nominal
	  variables, along with a fix for the USB to serial cable (patch from
	  Farkas Levente and Spiros Ioannou)
	* data/driver.list.in: Add Eaton Powerware 9140, using the serial
	  interface, ...  ...to the list of bcmxcp supported models

2011-02-25  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* docs/download.txt: Moved SHA-256 value into download page, and
	  reformatted a bit.

2011-02-24  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in: Add several upscode2 supported devices that
	  were reported on the list:
	  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsdev/2011-February/005281.html
	  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsuser/2005-July/000031.html

2011-02-21  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in, drivers/mge-hid.c: Add Eaton Ellipse ECO (with
	  Eco control support)...  ...to the list of usbhid-ups supported
	  models
	* drivers/eaton-mib.c: Add support for the first ambient sensor  (up
	  to 8 sensors can be supported) on Eaton ePDU managed
	* clients/upsrw.c: Add the missing 'help' handler ('-h') to the
	  supported options

2011-02-20  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c: Variables that have an
	  override.<variable> in ups.conf are now really immutable.  They
	  can't be changed anymore (not even if they would have been R/W
	  otherwise). Rationale is, that if a user wants to override a value,
	  we should honor that request.  Added documentation accordingly (and
	  corrected previous commit).
	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c, drivers/main.c: Add
	  'ignorelb' flag to list of UPS fields in ups.conf...  ...to
	  override the LB condition reported by the UPS.  This allows all
	  drivers that report battery.charge (battery.runtime) to shutdown
	  early by setting this flag and battery.charge.low
	  (battery.runtime.low) in ups.conf.
	* data/driver.list.in: Removing subdriver setting  (cypress is auto
	  detected for this VID:PID combination, so there is no need to
	  specify this in usb.conf)

2011-02-19  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* data/driver.list.in: Add Mustek Yukai PowerMust 1000 USB  Reported
	  by Noel David Torres Taño:
	  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsuser/2010-August/006163.html  Other models may be supported as
	  well. *
	  http://www.mustek.com.tw/Yukai/html/prod_ups/PowerMust1000.html *
	  http://www.mustek.com.tw/Yukai/html/UPS.html

2011-02-17  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/download.txt: Preliminary support for source release hash,
	  using unsigned SHA256 sum

2011-02-15  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* common/parseconf.c: In PCONF_CTX_t, argsize is an array of type
	  size_t values, ...  ...so instead of using sizeof(int *) we really
	  should use sizeof(size_t) for the size of individual elements

2011-02-15  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* data/driver.list.in: HCL: Re-add some devices to driver.list.in
	  from [[SVN:2516]]  These entries seem to have been dropped,
	  potentially due to the rename from driver.list to driver.list.in,
	  and the format change.

2011-02-11  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/libhid.c: Restore the nut-2.4.1 behavior for reading
	  reports from devices

2011-02-09  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/dummy-ups.c: Prefer 'snprintf' and 'snprintfcat' over
	  'strncat'  (the latter can overflow the destination buffer)

2011-02-09  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/dummy-ups.c: Fix a memory leak in dummy-ups driver

2011-02-08  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apc-hid.c: Add yet another way to shutdown the APC CS-500
	  [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsuser/2011-January/006550.html]

2011-02-02  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/mge-hid.c: Fix a wrong value mapping resolution, and bump
	  driver's HID data version to 1.20
	* docs/website/web-layout.conf: Unconditional inclusion of Google
	  Analytics code
	* docs/man/dummy-ups.txt, docs/man/metasys.txt, drivers/apcsmart.c,
	  drivers/dummy-ups.c, drivers/genericups.c, drivers/metasys.c,
	  drivers/snmp-ups.c: Fix some spelling errors (base patch from
	  Laurent Bigonville, from Debian)

2011-01-31  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* docs/documentation.txt, docs/download.txt: Update URL for Trac.

2011-01-28  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/security.txt: Fix content to satisfy Docbook
	* configure.in: Add missing variables setting, to allow AC_SUBST()
	  propagation

2011-01-27  Chetan Agarwal <chetanagarwal-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: Added implementation for 'test.system.start'
	  instant command.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.h: Added constants for return code and UPS status.
	* data/cmdvartab: Added description for 'test.system.start' command.
	* docs/new-names.txt: Added test.system.start variable

2011-01-22  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apc-hid.c: Add mappings to APC HID subdriver

	  server/netssl.h, server/upsd.c: Allow to specify server certificate

	* server/netssl.c: Add more 'lack of initialization' test.
	* clients/upsclient.c, server/conf.c, server/netssl.c, server/upsd.c:
