.TH TAYGA.CONF "5" "December 2010" "TAYGA 0.9.1" ""
.SH NAME
tayga.conf \- configuration file of the TAYGA stateless NAT64 daemon
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file contains the configuration parameters for the TAYGA stateless NAT64
daemon.  It must exist and contain the mandatory configuration items or
TAYGA will refuse to run.
.P
The configuration directives are listed below.  With the exception of the
.B map
directive, only one instance of each directive may appear in tayga.conf.
.TP
.BI "tun-device " device
Name of the network interface that will be created by the kernel TUN module
for TAYGA to exchange IPv4 and IPv6 packets with the in-kernel TCP/IP stack.
If
.I device
does not already exist as a persistent interface (created by the
.B \-\-mktun
flag to tayga(8), for example), it will be created automatically when the
TAYGA daemon starts and destroyed when the daemon exits.
.IP
Note that TAYGA does not configure the host-side parameters of
.I device.
This must be done by the system administrator using the ifconfig(8), route(8),
and/or ip(8) commands.
.IP
This configuration directive is mandatory.
.TP
.BI "ipv4-addr " ipv4_address
IPv4 address that TAYGA will use as the source address for ICMPv4 errors
generated by the translation process.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMP echo
requests (pings) at this address.
.IP
.I ipv4_address
is permitted to overlap with the prefix specified in the
.B dynamic-pool
directive, in which case
.I ipv4_address
will be removed from the pool of available addresses.
.IP
This configuration directive is mandatory.
.TP
.BI "ipv6-addr " ipv6_address
IPv6 address that TAYGA will use as the source address for ICMPv6 errors
generated by the translation process.  TAYGA will also respond to ICMPv6 echo
requests (pings) at this address.
.IP
This configuration directive is mandatory unless the NAT64 prefix is specified
with the
.B prefix
directive, in which case TAYGA will generate its IPv6 address by mapping the
address specified in
.B ipv4-addr
into the NAT64 prefix.
.TP
.BI "prefix " ipv6_address/length
NAT64 prefix for mapping IPv4 addresses into the IPv6 address space.  TAYGA
performs address translation as specified in RFC 6052, and only prefix lengths
allowed in that document will be permitted in the
.B prefix
directive.
.IP
The use of either a Network-Specific Prefix or the Well-Known Prefix
(64:ff9b::/96) is allowed,
.B however,
as required by RFC 6052, TAYGA will refuse to translate packets with a
source or destination address composed of the Well-Known Prefix and a
non-global IPv4 address (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, etc).
.IP
Use of the
.B prefix
directive is optional.  If it is not specified, all addresses to be translated
must be listed individually with the
.B map
directive.
.TP
.BI "map " "ipv4_address ipv6_address"
Creates a static mapping between
.I ipv4_address
and
.I ipv6_address
to be used when translating IPv4 packets to IPv6 or IPv6 packets to IPv4.
Multiple
.B map
directives are permitted in the tayga.conf file.
.IP
.I ipv4_address
is permitted to overlap with the prefix specified in the
.B dynamic-pool
directive, in which case
.I ipv4_address
will be removed from the pool of available addresses.
.IP
.I ipv6_address
.B "must not"
overlap with the prefix specified in the
.B prefix
directive.
.TP
.BI "dynamic-pool " ipv4_address/length
Address prefix containing addresses available to be assigned to IPv6 hosts.
.I
length
must be 31 or less, as the lowest-numbered address in the prefix is considered
reserved and will not be used for dynamic assignment.
.IP
If TAYGA receives an IPv6 packet to be translated with an IPv6 source address
that does not match any existing mapping rules (as specified by the
.B map
directive or the
.B prefix
directive), TAYGA will create a dynamic mapping between the IPv6 address and
an IPv4 address drawn from the prefix specified by the
.B dynamic-pool
directive.  This mapping will be valid for two hours and four minutes after
the last packet matching the mapping is translated.
.IP
The
.B dynamic-pool
directive is optional.  If it is not specified, all IPv6 addresses appearing
in packets passing through TAYGA must match the NAT64 prefix or a static
mapping rule.
.TP
.BI "data-dir " path
The absolute path of a directory where TAYGA should store its data files.
Presently the only data file that TAYGA will store is the
.I dynamic.map
file, which tracks dynamic address assignments made from the dynamic pool.
.IP
.I path
is also the directory that will be used as a chroot(2) "jail" if the
.B \-\-chroot
command-line option is specified to the TAYGA daemon.
.IP
The TAYGA daemon must have full permissions (rwx) to
.I path
after it has dropped superuser privileges.  Generally this means that the
owner of
.I path
should be the user specified in the
.B \-\-user
command-line option.
.IP
The
.B data-dir
directive is optional, but without it, dynamic mappings will be lost when the
TAYGA daemon is stopped.  Also, use of the
.B \-\-chroot
command-line option will not be possible.
