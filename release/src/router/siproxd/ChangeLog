  20-Jun-2011:  - removed obsolete files: addrcache.[ch]
  19-Jun-2011:  - new plugin_regex: apply an extended regular expression
                  to the SIP 'To' URI and rewrite the target (outgoing
                  calls only)
  17-Jun-2011:  - plugin_prefix: correct handling of outgoing ACKs
                  (could lead to calls being aborted by one side)
                - generic set of "redirect cache" that can be used by
                  plugins to keep track of Call-IDs when doing "302 Moved"
  12-Jun-2011:  - one-off in get_ip_by_ifname(), last interface in chain
                  was not considered in matching.
                - Pthread stack size made adjustable (thread_stack_size)
  11-Jun-2011:  - other stun server in example config file and
                  reworked some stun code.

                - fixed more compiler warnings [3086381]
                - configure.in: set library/include search paths before
                  searching for local libltdl installation [3086321]
  14-Oct-2010:  - fixed a number of compiler warnings (by Norm Brandinger)
                  [3086593,3086371,3086351]
  03-Oct-2010:  - use getifaddrs() to get the IP address of local interfaces.
                  This seems to be required with FreeeBSD jails.

0.8.0
=====
  23-Feb-2010:  - Released 0.8.0
  19-Feb-2010:  - CVE-2009-3736: use libltdl on host if existing and fall 
                  back using convenienve libltdl (with a config warning)
                - updated libtool version
  21-Jan-2010:  - Support for UPDATE (RFC3311)
  07-Jan-2010:  - Better handling of matching the local UAs
  15-Dec-2009:  - Better handling for SIP redirecting with newer kernels
  28-Oct-2009:  - Make local UA to local UA calls work better with UAs that
                  blindly practice symmetric RTP and ignore the SDP media
                  description completely.
  26-Oct-2009:  - plugin_stun: use external STUN server to determine
                  the public IP address of siproxd.
  13-Jul-2009:  - TCP keepalive feature - to avoid issues with changing
                  port numbers upon disconnect/reconnect a TCP connection.

0.7.2
=====
  11-Oct-2009:  - Released 0.7.2
  30-Jul-2009:  - RTP proxy could get confused and mess up RTP streams
                  if two local UAs did use the same usernames but register
                  on different providers. A call from UA1 to UA2 then could
                  mess up the audio.
  21-May-2009:  - Updated the documentation (plugin related stuff)
  24-Mar-2009:  - allow the usage of @ in shortdial entries to call
                  other users on other sip networks (patch by Andreas)
                - revised rpmbuild (SPEC file and some Makefiles)
   1-Mar-2009:  - building with --enable-static-libosip2 requires
                  --disable-shared to be set as well (plugins will
                  be statically linked into siproxd)
  28-Feb-2009:  - make install: install docu as well
                - properly handle some "--disable-*" configure options
                - added configure option: --disable-doc 
  22-Feb-2009:  - Reworked handling of plugin mechanism (libltdl "static"
                  inclusion of plugins should work now). Building under
                  Windows (with Cygwin) does work (build with
                  ./configure --enable-static-libosip2).
  11-Feb-2009:  - Don't abort RTP streams on ENOBUFS (Internet upstream
                  saturated and a Packet is dropped)
  24-Jan-2009:  - fixed an issue with RTP timeouts (on calls with multiple
                  media streams an timeout on one single stream would
                  cancel all streams in the end. Seen with X-Lite UAs)
  07-Jan-2009:  - fixed some senseless range checks on "Max-Forward"
                  and "Expires" headers (Thank you Alex for telling me)
  08-Nov-2008:  - check & define if SOL_IP not existing (some *BSDs)
                - honor PTHREAD_LDFLAGS from environment
  01-Aug-2008:  - SIP DSCP value configurable

0.7.1
=====
  23-Jul-2008:  - Released 0.7.1
  22-Jul-2008:  - fixes some signedness warnings
  17-May-2008:  - plugin_fix_bogus_via: fixes broken VIA headers on

                  http://babel.de/art20080317a.html for more info)
  22-Mar-2008:  - dejitter can be completely disabled by specifying 0ms
  09-Mar-2008:  - libosip2-3.1.0 (changes MD5 related function names)
  04-Feb-2008:  - 'Default Target' plugin: incoming calls to unknown
                  are redirected to a "catch-all" target.
  02-Feb-2008:  - More work on new plugin API.
                - moved Call Logging functionality to it's own plugin.

0.7.0
=====
  19-Jan-2008:  - Released 0.7.0
  19-Jan-2008:  - Converting to use libosip2-3.x.x
                  This means older libosip2 versions before 3.0.0
                  are no longer supported and will fail to build!

0.6.1
=====
  19-Jan-2008:  - Released 0.6.1
                  This will be the last release supporting libosip2-2.x.x.
                  With 0.7.0, siproxd will switch to the new version 
                  libosip2-3.x.x.
  20-Dec-2007:  - DNS failure cache: do several attempts before blacklisting
  28-Nov-2007:  - Fix: Detach from controlling TTY if daemonized
  22-Nov-2007:  - Working on code that that will allow siproxd to use
                  separate interfaces in its "in front of NAT router" setup.
                  ( UA1[LAN0]--siproxd--LAN1--NAT--Internet--UA2 )
  12-Nov-2007:  - Small changes to compile again under OpenBSD.

0.6.0
=====
  28-Oct-2007:  - Released 0.6.0
  03-Sep-2007:  - keep failed DNS attempts in cache for 10 minutes.
                  This should protect from repeating DNS timeouts
                  caused by broken DNS server (possible DOS)
  16-Aug-2007:  - added comment in siproxd.conf about hosts_allow_sip
  30-Jun-2007:  - some come cleanup in log.c (Bob Beers)
  22-Jun-2007:  - fixed an error in "my via" detection when using the
                  "host_outbound" config directive
  08-Jun-2007:  - Some cleanup in dejitter code
  29-May-2007:  - Deal with PRACK requests (RFC3262)
  25-May-2007:  - Just discovered some patches originating from Debian
                  project - included most of them as they make sense.
                  (Hint: People, if you get fixes, please drop me a note
                  and a .diff - I won't be biting you)
  24-May-2007:  - new feature: can masquerade User-agent header
                - new feature: can add ;rport to my own Via Headers
  13-May-2007:  - deal with locally running UAs on same host (inbound IF side)
  07-May-2007:  - Client-ID in RTP proxy is derived from Client IP address.
                  This should fix an issue with unexpectedly timing-out RTP
                  streams (actually too many RTP streams get started).
  21-Apr-2007:  - Hack to deal with Asterisks broken Alert-Info headers
                  (Asterisk in some setups does include Alert-Info header
                  without '<>'. Note, this is a configuration issue in
                  Asterisk, not an Asterisk bug!)
  19-Feb-2007:  - Increased RTP buffer size
  13-Oct-2006:  - Various fixes due to a code review by Andrew Jones

   9-Oct-2005:  - Expiration timeout is now taken from the REGISTER response
                - fix: no audio with some UAs that do not include a
                  Contact header in ACK messages (which is compliant).
                - static build works again
   1-Oct-2005:  - [1278537] Read proxy_auth_pwfile after config file is read
                - [1278591] Proxy-Authenticate header not included in response
                - process empty Contact header (means "query registrations")
                  (only supported for registrations at a remote server)

                - again: using a port number != 5060
  27-Jun-2004:  - fix: in some configurations incoming requests could
                  be sent to a wrong port number.

0.5.7
=====
  24-Jun-2004:  - Released 0.5.7
  18-Jun-2004:  - 2 fixes for using a port number != 5060 (by Miguel Angel)
  13-Jun-2004:  - fix: get_ip_by_host() and buffer allocation for reentrant
                  gethostbyname_r() functions
                - if compiled for fli4l 2.0.x, don't use reentrant
                  gethostbyname_r() - in some cases it fails reproduceably
                  when running under fli4l (however, the same binary
                  does behave properly under an old SUSE libc5 system)
  12-Jun-2004:  - use SIGUSR2 for dmalloc debugging (SIGUSR1 is occupied
                  with old libc5 & threads)
                - reworked calling parameters for passing SIP data
  11-Jun-2004:  - silenced some MSN Messenger provoked WARNings
  29-May-2004:  - "determine next hop" also takes Route header into account
                  (outgoing packets only, incoming can not have a proxy

  16-May-2004:  - INFO/WARN/ERROR are always logged to syslog, even
                  if running in foreground (syslog still can be silenced
                  using the silence_log config option)
  09-May-2004:  - Authentication headers: enquote Realm (linphone)
                - complain about empty values in config file
                - fli4l-uclibc: statically link against libpthread
                  (as it seems to be not included in fli4l distribution)
  02-May-2004:  - better recognition of redirected incoming requests
                  (like INVITES from sipgate.de - SIP URI points to
                  the real wanted target but To: header only points to
                  the initially wanted target before the redirection)
                - compiling on BSD (fwapi.c, custom_fw_module.c)
  11-Apr-2004:  - on termination, stop all active RTP streams
  24-Apr-2004:  - simplified SIP RX & TX routines

  11-Apr-2004:  - Released 0.5.5
   9-Apr-2004:  - SDP body: do rewrite 'o=' (originator) address, too
                - siproxd can be linked to a customer firewall control
                  module (library) that will be called for each RTP
                  stream that is started/stopped.
   8-Apr-2004:  - small FAQ updates
   5-Apr-2004:  - config file: don't complain on lines with only whitespaces

                  on some malformed headers
   4-Apr-2004:  - Realtime Scheduling for RTP proxy
   3-Apr-2004:  - fix: SDP 'c=' items in media part

  22-Mar-2004:  - deal with wildcard Contact header for unREGISTER
                - enhanced security tests to survive the PROTOS test
  21-Mar-2004:  - added ./autogen.sh
                - security_check_sip: check existence of mandatory headers
  19-Mar-2004:  - proxy_rewrite_invitation_body: check success of
                  starting RTP relay before rewriting SDP body
                - proxy_rewrite_invitation_body: don't fail on
                  Contact header with no user part.
  18-Mar-2004:  - security_check_sip: CSeq header must be present.

0.5.4
=====
   6-Mar-2004:  - Released 0.5.4
                - Some FAQ updates
  21-Feb-2004:  - Proxy Authorization: enclose strings with quotes

                  requests pass through to a 3rd party registrar.
  17-Feb-2004:  - Documentation spell corrections (patch from Luke Mewburn)

  14-Feb-2004:  - Released 0.5.3
                - Removed superfluous backslashes for line continuation
  11-Feb-2004:  - Use same SIP port number for RX & TX (-> support
                  symmetric SIP signalling)
   7-Feb-2004:  - Fix for local-UA to local-UA RTP proxying, symmetric
                  RTP was not working.
                - logging routines now use a MUTEX to be thread safe.
                - RTP proxy: fixed a bug that could lead to a deadlock
                  on very rapid HOLD/unHOLD sequences.
   1-Feb-2004:  - Added handling of Max-Forwards header
                - a detected via loop results in an 482 Loop detected
  31-Jan-2004:  - Allow 2 of my vias in header to let 2 UA's sitting
                  behind the same siproxd have conversation together
                  UA1 -->--\   >   /-->--\
                            siproxd       Registrar
                  UA2 --<--/   <   \--<--/
                - Redone code for evaluation if a received packet
                  is coming from the inbound or outbound network
                - RTP streams are now identified by call_id AND
                  USERNAME of the contact header. This provides
                  support for RTP proxying between 2 UAs sitting on the
                  inbound network. -> Calls between local UAs going via
                  siproxd should now work.
                  UA1 -->--\
                            siproxd 
                  UA2 --<--/ 
                - Rewriting of SUBSCRIBE messages should now work.
                - Removed obsolete prototypes from rtpproxy.h
                - If the RTP stream in one direction is found to be
                  aborted (sendto() failure), also stop the stream
                  for the opposite direction

0.5.2
=====
  31-Jan-2004:  - Released 0.5.2
  30-Jan-2004:  - If RTP proxy is disabled, don't rewrite incomming
                  SDP bodies (patch from Robert Högberg)
  29-Jan-2004:  - new doc/RFC3261_compliance.txt and comments in the
                  code that refer to the RFC.
  28-Jan-2004:  - don't die on INVITE requests that include no Contact
                  header - which is legal. (patch from Robert Högberg)
                - RTP proxy: don't try to forward empty RTP packets
                - renamed some variables of rtp_proxytable_t to make
                  better sense (changed meaning in fullduplex RTP proxy)
  27-Jan-2004:  - added doc/KNOWN_BUGS
                - better branch parameter calculation (via header),
                  now honors RFC3261 for stateless proxies (section 16.11)
                - SIP request: remove a Route header pointing to myself.
                  This was an issue with Linphone 0.12.1.
                  (patch from Robert Högberg).
                - removed IPCHAINS & IPTABLES (netfilter) proxy support
                - RTPPROXY correction: match RTP ports crosswise -
                  use one single port (and socket) on each side (inbound/
                  outbound) to send and receive RTP traffic for every
                  active stream (patch from Christof Meerwald).
  22-Jan-2004:  - ./configure option: --enable-static to build
                  a completely statically linked executable
                - REGISTER honors the expires parameter
                  of the contact header
                - Contact header of REGISTER response must be
                  rewritten back to the local (true) URL
  18-Jan-2004:  - security_check_raw:
                  size check: >= 16 bytes
                - at exit, check registration file to be writable
                - no WARNING if SIP user-agent header is not supplied.
                - Call logging: distinguish between In & Out
                - include branch parameter for via headers

0.5.1
=====
  22-Dec-2003:  - Released 0.5.1
  21-Dec-2003:  - possibility to log call establishment
  17-Dec-2003:  - full duplex RTP proxy (many thanks to Chris Ross for
                  his work on this). Up to now, only the RTP *Relay*
                  has been tested (it works with KPhone, BudgeTone)
                - fix: SIP phones that allocate a random port for
                  incomming SIP traffic should now work (like BudgeTone)
                - fix: some SIP phones do change the RTP port number
                  during a session (like KPhone during HOLD/unHOLD)
                - textual corrections
  15-Dec-2003:  - use only even port numbers for RTP traffic
  05-Dec-2003:  - some changes & enhancements inspired by Chris Ross:
                  * 183 Trying *may* contain SDP data
                  * compare_url: now does compare the scheme,
                    if a host is not resolveable, hostnames will be
                    compared as strings
  04-Dec-2003:  - have registrations persistent across restarts of
                  the daemon ('registration_file' config option)
  29-Nov-2003:  - some documentation & FAQ updates

0.5.0
=====
  26-Nov-2003:  - released 0.5.0
                - included preliminary support for IPTABLES (netfiler)
                  based systems.
  24-Nov-2003:  - some fixes in sockbind() (FreeBSD) by Jeremy Shaw
  23-Nov-2003:  - got the gethostbyname() failure problem solved.
                  (the resolver needs a shared lib that was tried
                  to load AFTER chrooting...)
  22-Nov-2003:  - utils.c: use gethostbyname_r() in favor of
                  gethostbyname - if available (siproxd uses threads!)
                - some small items & cleanup
  19-Nov-2003:  - Integrated a patch from Chris Ross:
                  * have siproxd compile on Solaris and BSD/OS (more to come)
                  * ./configure option --with-libosip-prefix
                  * properly handle getopt_long()/getopt()
  18-Nov-2003:  - readconfig.c: include sysconfdir to the list of locations
                  where siproxd will search for its config file
  14-Nov-2003:  - rtpproxy.c: sys/types.h needed for *BSD
                - tested: siproxd builds on FreeBSD 4.9
   2-Nov-2003:  - rtpproxy bugfix: On repetitive INVITES, the UDP media
                  port could end up as -1 in the rewritten packet.
   1-Nov-2003:  - siproxd can use another outbound proxy (chaining)
                - Linux 2.4.x: siproxd with RTP relay could hang
                  on termination (Thread termination). Fixed.
                  
0.4.2
=====
  31-Oct-2003:  - released 0.4.2
                - Makefile: install siproxd to sbin (was bin)
  24-Oct-2003:  - SPEC file: included config files & more docu
  19-Oct-2003:  - included compiling support for DMALLOC debugging
                - fixed 2 memory leaks in proxy.c

0.4.1
=====
  12-Oct-2003:  - released 0.4.1
  12-Oct-2003:  - Local registration of UAs was simply broken. Fixed.

0.4.0
=====
  11-Oct-2003:  - released 0.4.0
  08-Oct-2003:  - rtpproxy_masq: fixed an issue in port allocation
                  which lead to syslog entries from IPCHAINS complaining
                  about 'already used connection' in the syslog.
                - added INFO() for incomming SIP Calls
  04-Oct-2003:  - Siproxd now also works as outbound proxy 'only',
                  means that local UAs may register themselfes to a
                  3rd party registrar and use siproxd only as oubound
                  proxy for masquerading purpose.
                - fixed some errors with callid handling (NULL pointers)
  24-Sep-2003:  - corrected the calling arguments of rtp_masq dummy
                  routines (non IPCHAINS capable kernels)
  22-Sep-2003:  - '\0' termination of read() SIP telegram from line

0.3.6
=====
  22-Sep-2003:  - released 0.3.6
                - Code cleanup for RTP proxy
  07-Sep-2003:  - IPCHAINS based UDP tunneling (kernel masquerading)
                  for RTP traffic (still experimental - but seems to work).
                  To activate it, just set 'rtp_proxy_enable' equal 2
                  in the config. NOTE: siproxd must then be started by
                  root (but dropping privileges works).
  05-Sep-2003:  - configure.in: test for pthreads before libosip (RH9.0)

0.3.5
=====
 30-Aug-2003:   - released 0.3.5
 20-Aug-2003:   - security tests: responses may have empty SIP URI
                  don't fail there.
                - increase size of call_id for RTP proxy table and
                  include a size check.
                - rtpproxy: cleaned up some stuff with handling of FD's

0.3.4
=====
 05-Aug-2003:   - released 0.3.4
 31-Jul-2003:   - now supports OSIP2 only (due to rather big changes
                  in the API libosip -> libosip2). Compiles cleanly w/
                  libosip2 2.0.2

0.3.3
=====
 05-Jul-2003:   - released 0.3.3

                - more debug and error testing (MOREDEBUG)
  6-Apr-2003:   - build options for FLI4L builds (libc5 & uClibc)

0.3.2
=====
 5-Apr-2003:    - released 0.3.2
 4-Apr-2003:    - introduced config option 'silence_log' - this allows
                  to control how much logging is done to syslog - 
                  logging can even completely be switched off...
 1-Apr-2003:    - should now be able to deal with an outbound interface
                  that is "temporary" DOWN (dial up internet access)
                  if outbound IF is down, send back a response to
                  inbound UAs "408 Request Timeout".
                - always log to syslog, also when running in foreground
                - changed some WARNINGS into DEBUG statements
                - re-arranged some code
                - rtpproxy: prepared for proper thread termination on exit
                - introduced short term caching for get_ip_by_ifname
                - fixed check for socket() return status
                - fixed bug in RTP Proxy (timeout of inactive streams)
                  that produced a bunch of "ERROR:Error in close(0): Bad file
                  descriptor" errors each time a RTP stream timed out
                - fixed daemonizing (libc5) - now it properly detaches
30-May-2003:    - always log ERROR, WARNING and INFO to syslog (also
                  if not running as daemon)
                - minor corrections on ERROR printouts

0.3.1
=====
- 29-May-2003:  - released 0.3.1
                - fix in configure.in for statically linking to libosip
                - fix in rewriting SIP messages, figure out proper
                  destination if *not* rewriting the SIP URI
                - another NULL pointer related crash (no UA header present)

0.3.0
=====
- 29-May-2003:  - released 0.3.0
                - supports libosip2 (automatically detect osip1/osip2)
                - redone authentication - now should work with libosip2
                  libosip0.8.8 has a bug (fails in parse_msg)
- 28-May-2003:  - changes in rewriting SIP messages - not everything
                  is blindly rewritten now (e.g. SUBSCRIBE is NOT)
                - fixed resource leak (sockets) in get_ip_by_ifname
- 26-Mar-2003:  - Bugfix: some potential NULL pointers passed to atoi()
                  of optional fields in SIP message could lead to crash
- 23-Mar-2003:  - send 403 FORBIDDEN response to requests addressed
                  to proxy itself (-> SUBSCRIBE bug) 

0.2.8
=====
- 23-Mar-2003:  - released 0.2.8
                - made compile with uClibc (see doc/FLI4L_HOWTO.txt)
- 22-Mar-2003:  - made compile on SUSE5.3 (libc5)
                - added --enable-almost-static feature switch. This will
                  build siproxd statically linked against libosip & pthreads
                  (for Fli4l use)
- 16-Mar-2003:  - ERROR on unknown keywords in config file
                - introduced INFO logging

0.2.7
=====
- 15-Mar-2003:  - released 0.2.7
-  9-Mar-2003:  - replaced get_ip_by_ifname by simpler code 
                  (still to be *BSD tested)
                - removed old host-name based style for in/outbound interface
                  configuration. This is only done via interface names
                - experimental: The host part of UA registration entries
                  can be masqueraded (mask_host, masked_host config items)
                  Siemens SIP phones seem to need this 'feature'.

0.2.6
=====
- 28-Jan-2003:  - released 0.2.6
                - New Feature: RTP proxy should be able to handle multiple
                  media stream in the same session (audio + video)
- 21-Jan-2003:  - Bugfix: crash in compare_url (MSN Messenger issue)
- 19-Jan-2003:  - use of libosip-0.9.3 not possible yet -
                  libosip fails in msg_setproxy_authenticate
                  -> Bug in libosip? to be investigated!
                - give IP address in debug for 'received packet'
                - 'WARNING:proxy.c:202 request from/to unregistered UA' now
                  includes sender and destination url
- 17-Jan-2003:  - OpenBSD: do not link against gnugetopt (Luke Renn)

0.2.5a
======
-  6-Dec-2002:  - released 0.2.5a (major bugfixes)
                - Bugfix: interfaces on odd positions (the 1st , 3rd, 5th)
                  have been skipped during the search (ip by interface)
                - Bugfix: MSN messenger 4.6 caused a segfault due to
                  non supplied username in contact header during
                  registration. (Credits to Dhiraj Bhuyan for the hint)
                  Included additional tests in that area.
-  4-Dec-2002:  - fixed a major (but stupid) bug in check_vialoop. Siproxd
                  wrongly claimed to have detected a loop...

0.2.4
=====
- 23-Nov-2002:  - released 0.2.4 (feature enhancements)
                - BSD: resolved some compatibility issues (sscanf ->
                  resulted in coredump when reading config file)
                  should now build on *BSD (tested on FreeBSD 4.7)
                - inbound/outbound interfaces now can be specified
                  by their interface name - this removes the need
                  for a 'quasi' static IP and restarting siproxd at
                  change of IP address.
- 13-Nov-2002:  - working on portability - goal is building on *BSD
                  (feedback from Georg Schwarz)
0.2.3
=====
- 10-Nov-2002:  - released 0.2.3 (minor fixes)
-  9-Nov-2002:  - make install also installs a sample password file
                  (/etc/siproxd_passwd.cfg)
-  8-Nov-2002:  - string manipulations & data structures: better error
                  handling on some places.
-  2-Nov-2002:  - 'make install' install now a template config file
                  (/etc/siproxd.conf.example)
- 24-Oct-2002:  - small docu updates in README
- 17-Oct-2002:  - fix in ./configure - abort on missing libraries

0.2.2
=====
- 12-Oct-2002:  - Released version 0.2.2
                - '-d' commandline option supersedes config file setting
                  of debug_level.
                - reworked return status from functions - now uses
                  symbolic values and is more consistent
                - added individual user passwords for authentication

0.2.1
=====
- 28-Sep-2002:  - Released version 0.2.1
- 27-Sep-2002:  - first implementation of proxy authentication (for REGISTER)
- 24-Sep-2002:  - if daemonized, log to syslog
- 22-Sep-2002:  - added access list support for registration and incoming
                  SIP packets.
- 21-Sep-2002:  - added RPM support (Spec File)

0.2.0
=====
- 17-Sep-2002:  - Released version 0.2.0
- 15-Sep-2002:  - added functionality to change user ID (drop privs)
                  after startup (configurable)
                - added optional chroot jail (configurable)

0.1.3
=====
- 11-Sep-2002:  - Fixed a error in the autoconf/automake part of the project.
                  (scripts subdirectory was missing in the tar.gz archive.
                  This resulted in an error during ./configure - complaining
                  about non existent install-sh script)
                - startup is more silent - set initial debug level to 0
- 10-Sep-2002:  - Some (yea, I know...) -minor- docu updates
-  8-Sep-2002:  - Masquerade Contact Headers of inbound clients
                  (Contact header will be used by the remote SIP
                  user agent to directly contact the local user agent -
                  and bypassing the proxy. This of course will *not* work
                  if the local user agent is located in a private IP range.)
                - Performance optimizations in RTP proxy
                - Bugfix: now masqueraded clients work with any
                  SIP port (other than 5060). Before, incoming
                  requests/responses where always sent to port 5060.

0.1.2
=====
-  7-Sep-2002:  - Released version 0.1.2
                - fixed registration concept (SIP Contact header is not
                  a *must* to be present in every frame)
                - Experimental RTP proxying feature (using pthreads)
- 26-Aug-2002:  - Optimized DNS caching

0.1.1
=====
- 25-Aug-2002:  - Released version 0.1.1
                - can daemonize (detach and run in background)
